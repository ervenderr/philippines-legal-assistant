No. 254757 GCG p •o r to the implementation of the RA TPLAN effectively constituted illegal ismissal. 18 I its Comment dated April 19, 2018, the SRA argued, among others, that pet tioners were not illegally dismissed since they voluntarily applied for early re irement and that the non-payment of the ERIP benefits was due to ances beyond its control.19 eanwhile, on October 24, 2016, the SRA received from the DBM the approv d 2016 Corporate Operating Budget which, however, excluded the SRA's equest for supplemental budget to cover the ERIP benefits based on the sam reasons given by the GCG in its August 8, 2016 Letter,20 i.e., absence of the i plementing guidelines for EO No. 203, series of 2016. oreover, on July 28, 2017, then President Rodrigo Duterte issued EO No. 36, series of 2017, suspending the CPCS, including the provision on ERIP, nder EO No. 203, series of 2016.

No. 254757 intentio and availed of the retirement/separation package under the SRA's RATP AN. Since the RATPLAN was formulated pursuant to EO No. 203, series o 2016 and RA 10149, and petitioners' separation/retirement from the SRA w s made pursuant thereto, their separation from the service cannot be conside ed illegal under the Constitution. Consequently, the non payme t/non-receipt of the retirement/separation pay and other benefits will not ren er illegal the otherwise legal cause of their separation. 24 In view thereof, the CSC additionally ruled that petitioners' prayer for reinstatement and pa ent of back salaries and benefits are improper as the same are warrant d only when the government employee was exonerated of the admini trative charges.25 his notwithstanding, the CSC held that petitioners \"are not left without recours \" as \"[t]hey may file their claims with the proper authorit:y.\"26 Meanw ile, it directed the SRA \"to facilitate the payment and release of [their] 'RIP benefits with great dispatch.\"21 he CSC's July 3, 2019 Decision became final and executory per the Certific te ofFinality28 dated August 6, 2019.

The Case Before the Court titioners argue that they have a clear and unmistakable right for the release nd payment of their ERIP benefits and there is no other plain, speedy, and ade uate remedy in the ordinary course oflaw. Petitioners assert that with the pa ial implementation of the SRA's RATPLAN resulting in their separati n from the service affective August 1, 2016, they acquired a clear and u istakable right to the ERIP benefits which was offered and which they availed fpursuant to the approved RATPLAN.54 ongruently, petitioners claim that respondents unlawfully neglected the perfi rmance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. In this respect, petitioners point out that under Section 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 10154, the retirem nt benefits of retiring government employees shall be released to them w thin thirty days from their actual retirement date. While the running of the 0-day period can be tolled, the same can be justified only upon occurre ce off orce majeure or other insuperable circumstances.55 their case, petitioners claim that after receiving the funds intended ayment of their ERIP benefits from the DBM, the SRA has no other option ut to comply with its ministerial duty to release and pay the same pursuan to the IRR of RA 10154. As for the GCG, petitioners contend that the latt has no authority to advice the SRA to withhold the payment of the ERIP b nefits, notwithstanding the issuance of EO No. 36, series of 2017, because of the mandatory nature of the early release of the retirement benefits under 10154, and because EO No. 36, series of 2017, being prospective, covers nly government employees starting 2017 onwards. 56 F nally, petitioners underscore that despite their separation from the n August 1, 2016 and their numerous efforts to follow-up on the and release of the ERIP benefits, including the finality of the CSC directing the SRA to release the same, as well as their letters and appeal t the GCG and the OP which to date remain unanswered, they have yet to r ceive their ERIP benefits. Thus, they argue that they are left with no 54 Id. at 9-32. 55 Id. at 3 -35. 56 Id. Decision 11 G.R. No. 254757 recours but to file the present petition for mandamus before the Court to: (i) declare he ERIP to be valid and enforceable; (ii) declare GCG MC No. 2017- 03, whi h suspended their ERIP, as contrary to law; and (iii) \"command all respond nts to immediately pay and release their ERIP benefits with acceler ed dispatch. \"57 I their Comment,58 respondents GCG and DBM, through the OSG, primarilr argued that the Petition still suffers from fatal defects, despite the opportu ity given to petitioners to correct the same, and the filing thereof directly before the Court, violated the hierarchy of courts principle. Specifi lly, the OSG highlights the following defects in the petition: (a) the certific ion against forum shopping is not signed by all petitioners; (b) the Petition contains a false certification against forum shopping by stating that they ha e not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues a d that to the best of their knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending since as admitted, thirty-four of them filed before the Ombudsman a complai t involving the same issues; and (c) that the Petition does not specify the nam of all petitioners59 in the caption.60 Lastly, the OSG claims that the petition should have been filed before the Regional Trial Court-which has concurr nt jurisdiction over petitions for mandamus-and that the petition requires a determination of a question of fact, i.e., whether the requirements for the elease of their ERIP benefits have been complied with, which the Court c nnot resolve, it not being a trier of facts.61 n the merits, the OSG asserts that while petitioners are entitled to any benefits that may be due them under existing laws and rules, they nonetheless, failed t point out a clear legal right on their part to demand the release of their E P benefits and the corresponding ministerial duty on the part of the GCG a d the DBM to release the same that would justify the issuance of a writ of andamus. ·rstly, the OSG points out that petitioners' ERIP benefits are based on the S 's RATPLAN which was formulated and approved pursuant to EO No. 203, series of 2016. EO No. 203, series of 2016, however, required, as a precon •t ion for the computation and release of the ERIP benefits, the issuanc by the GCG of the corresponding implementing guidelines-which require ent the SRA ignored by setting the effectivity date of petitioners' early re irement on August 1, 2016 despite the GCG's reminders.63 51 Id. at 5-40. 58 Id. at 02-116. 59 Id. at 92.

Decision 12 G.R. No. 254757 orse, the OSG argues that the SRA implemented the RA TPLAN prior to the BM' s resolution of the former' s request tbr the inclusion in its 2016 Corpor te Operating Budget (COB) the needed amount for the payment of the ERIP b nefits which, lamentably, the DBM was constrained to deny for the same re son that the needed implementing guidelines for EO No. 203, series of 201 had not yet been issued. 64 Compounding the situation was the issuanc of EO No. 36, series of 2017, and the corresponding implementing guideli es under MC No. 2017-03, which suspended the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2017, including the provision on the ERIP.65 Parenth tically, the OSG argues that the subsequent issuance of EO No. 150, series f 2021 does not affect petitioners' case since the same applies prospec ively.66 S condly, the OSG counters petitioners' reliance on RA 10154 by pointin out that the mandatory release of the retirement benefits within the 30-day eriod is subject to the proviso that all the \"requirements are submitted to the c ncerned government agency at least 90 days prior to the effective date of retire\\ ent.\" In petitioners' case, this condition has not been complied with since th SRA submitted its request for supplemental budget with the DBM only on June 22, 2016 or 45 days before the effective date of petitioners' retirem nt on August 1, 2016.67 ·nally, the OSG asserts that the GCG and the DBM's respective duties with r spect to the retirement benefits of retired/retiring government employ es are discretionary, not ministerial. It argues that nowhere in RA 10149 •s it provided that the GCG has a ministerial duty to release the retirem nt benefits to GOCCs. At most, it has the duty to implement the SRA's eorganization plan, which covers petitioners' ERIP benefits. This duty, h wever, is discretionary since EO No. 203, series of 2016 specifically gave th GCG the authority to decide the requirements for and the details of the exe ution of the ERIP. Moreover, RA 10149 qualified the GCG's duty to implem nt the reorganization of GOCCs by a· contrary directive of the Preside t. In petitioners' case, the implementation of the SRA's RA TPLAN, includi g the payment of the ERIP benefits, was qualified by the contrary directiv of the President under EO No. 36, series of 2017 suspending the implem ntation of EO No. 203, series of2016.68 nent the DBM, the OSG points out that under the GCG Memorandum 2012-0 , the DBM has the duty to evaluate the annual budgetary support to GOCCs and evaluate and approve the annual COB of GOCCs, while under Rule V, Section l0(e) of the CSC Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013 i plementing RA 10154, the DBM has the duty to verify the 64 Id. at 00-201. 65 Id. at 01-202. 66 Id. at 88. 61 Id. at 02-203. 68 Id. at 03-205. 13 G.R. No. 254757 comput tion and ascertainment of whether the grant and amount of retirement benefit are in accordance with the law, among others. 69 their Reply70 to the GCG and the DBM's Comment, petitioners primari y claim the failure to include in the petition's caption of the names of some etitioners was due to mere inadvertence and at any rate, these petition rs signed the verification and certification of non-forum shopping which rms part of the body of the Petition. In this regard, petitioners invoke relaxati n of the strict application of the rules in the interest of justice and in view o the special and compelling circumstances of this case involving retired civil servants who have long been deprived of their retirement benefit .71 dditionally, petitioners argue that they did not commit forum shoppi nor was the certification they signed was falsified since the parties and cau es of action in the case filed before the Ombudsman and the present petition are different. 72 They likewise claim that their case presents special and co pelling reasons that justify direct recourse before the Court. 73 I L stly, anent the merits, petitioners maintain that they have a clear and unmista able right for the release and payment of their ERIP benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof. 74 The Issue Before the Court T e issue before the Court is whether mandamus should be issued against espondents to compel the release of petitioners' retirement benefits The Court's Ruling T e Petition is partly meritorious. I. the outset, the OSG, on behalf of GCG and DBM, prays for the outright dismissal of the Petition since (i) it was purportedly filed in violation of the h erarchy of courts and (ii)-the certification of non-forum shopping is not sig ed by all petitioners and that the same contains false certification 69 Id. 70 Id. at 312-328. 71 Id. at 314-317. 72 Id. at 3 7-318. 13 Id. at 3 7-318. 14 Id. at 3 8-325.

T e principle or doctrine of hierarchy of courts recognizes the jurisdic •o n and the various levels of courts in the country as they are establis ed under the Constitution and by law, and their relationship with one another. 5 It guides litigants as to the proper venue of appeals and/or the approp ate forum for the issuance of extraordinary writs. 76 It recognizes, too, the prac ical need to restrain parties from directly resorting to the Court when relief m y be obtained before the lower courts in order to prevent \"'inordinate demand upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters ithin its exclusive jurisdiction,' as well as to prevent the congestion of the ourt's dockets,\"77 and prevent the inevitable and resultant delay, intende or otherwise, in the adjudication of cases which often have to be remand d or referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of procedu e, or as the court better equipped to resolve factual questions.78 U der the Constitution's structure, the Supreme Court is designated as the high st court with irreducible powers, 79 whose rulings serve as precedents that oth r courts must follow because they form part of the law of the land. All oth courts are established and given their defined jurisdictions by law. As a rul , the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts and generally rules only on questio s of law;80 in contrast with the Court of Appeals and other 1s Associ tion of Medical Clinics for Overseas Workers, Inc. v.

At the lowest evel of courts are the municipal and the regional trial courts which also ha dle questions of fact and law at the first instance according to the j urisdic ion granted to them by law. 81 P rsuant to the foregoing structure and by its very essence, the hierarc y principle commands that cases must first be brought before the lowest ourt with jurisdiction, and not before the higher courts. These cases may ult mately reach the Supreme Court through the medium of an appeal or certior ri.82 Considering that jurisdiction and the leveling of the courts are defined by law, the hierarchy should leave very little opening for flexibility ( and po ential legal questions), except for the fact that the law has conferred concurr ntjurisdictions for certain cases or remedies to courts at different and defined levels. Petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and ha eas corpus, fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the regional trial courts a d the higher courts, including the Supreme Court. 83 Thus, parties are, as a ru e, required to file these petitions before the lower-ranked court; otherwi e, the petition may be dismissed outright. 84 onetheless, there are recognized exceptions to the general rule. In these si uations, the Court allows direct filing of the cases before it based on its auth rity to relax the application of its own rules. 85 Among the recognized excepti ns developed by case law' include: (a ) genuine issues of constit ionality that must be addressdd at the most immediate time;86 (b) (e) All cases in which only an error or question of law is involved.

As the Court held: \"the presence of one or more of the so called ' pecial and important reasons' is not the decisive factor considered by the Co in deciding whether to permit the invocation, at the first instance, of its orig\" al jurisdiction over the issuance of extraordinary writs. Rather, it is the na re of the question raised by the parties in those 'exceptions' that enable us to allow the direct action before us.\"89 this case, while the issue raised is not purely legal, the Court, in its discreti n, will nonetheless allow petitioners direct recourse and resolve the Petition on its merits in the broader interest ofj ustice, as will be discussed. oreover, the Court is compelled to address the issue raised in view of the exig ncy of the situation wherein petitioners appear to have been left with no othe plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. N otabl , there is no dispute that petitioners retired/separated from the SRA on August , 2016 pursuant to the ERIP that it offered to facilitate its RAT PLAN which t e GCG approved. Despite their retirement/separation on August 1, 2016, p titioners have not received any retirement benefits from the SRA to date- hich fact likewise remains undisputed. From the time they retired from th SRA, petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies before the SRA, th GCG and even before the OP, among others, to secure the release of their retirement benefits-all of which proved futile.

No. 254757 sever~l of them have filed a complaint before the Ombudsman involving the same 1s ues. ule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, as further amended, states that \"the pl intiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other i itiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certific tion annexed thereto and simultaneous~y filed therewith: a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same is ues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his kno ledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status t ereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action r claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) alendar days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initi tory pleading has been filed.\" The failure of the plaintiff or principal party to comply therewith \"shall not be curable by mere amendment of the compla\"nt or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice.\" Thus, as a rule, all the plaintiff or principal parties to a cas must sign the certification of non-forum shopping, failing in which will wa ant the dismissal of the case. owever, in Altres v. Empleo,91 the Court held that the failure of the otherp itioners to sign the certification of non-forum shopping for justifiable reasons should not result in the outright dismissal of the case. Verily, the signing of the certification by more than a majority of the petitioners, as in this cas , \"already sufficiently assures the Court that the allegations in the pleadin are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of spec lation; that the pleading is filed in good faith; and that the signatories are unq estionably real parties-in-interest who undoubtedly have sufficient knowle ge and belief to swear to the truth of the allegations in the petition.\"92 To prov de guidance for the bench, the bar, and the public, the Court inAltres further summarized the guidelines found in case law respecting non compli ce with the requirements on, or submission of defective, verification and cert fication of non-forum shopping, viz.: For the guidance of the bench and bar, the Court restates in capsule the jurisprudential pronouncements already reflected above respecting n n-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of defective, v rification and certification against forum shopping: I) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the r uirement on or submission ofd efective verification, and non-compliance w th the requirement on or submission of defective certification against ~ m shopping. 91 594 P ·1. 246 (2008) [Per J. Carpio Morales, En Banc]. 92 Id. at 0. Decision 19 G.R. No. 254757 2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein d es not necessarily render the· pleading fatally defective. The court may o der its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending c cumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be d spensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby. 3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one o has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the c mplaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the p tition have been made in good faith or are true and correct. 4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance t erewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not c rable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the round of \"substantial com liance\" resence of \"s ecial circumstances or com ellin reasons.\" 5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by a the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not si n will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or • stifiable circumstances however as when all the laintiffs or titioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of a tion or defense the si nature of onl one of them in the certification a ainst forum sho in substantiall com lies with the Rule. 6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be e ecuted by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for re sonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must e ecute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to on his behalf. 93 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) re, petitioners undoubtedly share a common interest and invoke a comma cause of action, i.e., the release of their long-awaited ERIP benefits which t ey availed of pursuant to the SRA's RATPLAN which they have yet to recei e despite their separation from the service since 2016. Under these circums ances, petitioners' substantial compliance with the requirements of the rule and the presence of special and compelling reasons should not merit the out •g ht dismissal of their petition without defeating the administration of justice. F nally, the alleged false certification must be brushed aside for lack of merit. petitioners aptly argued, the parties and causes of action in the case filed be re the Ombudsman and the present Petition are different. Indeed, the complai t before the Ombudsman was filed against the administrator94 of the SRA an , while praying for the release of their ERIP benefits, essentially sought t hold the latter liable for non-compliance with the CSC's Decision and for iolation of RA 10154 and Section 5(a) of RA 6713. In contrast, the present etition filed against the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM ultimately 93 Id. at 2 1-262; citations omitted. 94 Specifi ally named as respondent was SRA Administrator Hermenigildo R. Serafica; rollo, p. 63. 20 G.R.

II. P oceeding to the merits oft he petition, petitioners argue that they have a clear nd unmistakable right for the release and payment of their retirement benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof and wh~ch respondents unlawfully neglected to perform. The GCG and the DBM, n the other hand, assert that petitioners failed to point out a clear legal right o their part to demand the release of these benefits and the corresp nding ministerial duty on the part oft he GCG and the DBM to release the sam . nd concept ofm andamus andamus is a command issuing from a court of law of competent jurisdic •o n, in the name of the state or sovereign, directed to some in erior court, tribunal, or board, or to some corporation or person, equiring the performance of a particular duty therein specified, which duty res Its from the official station of the party to whom the writ is directed, or from peration of law. It is an extraordinary remedy issued only in cases of extreme necessity where the ordinary course of procedure is powerless to afford adequate and speedy relief to one who has a clear legal right to the perform nee of the act to be compelled.95 Moreover, its principal function is to com and and to expedite, not to inquire and to adjudicate96 U1 der our Rules, the remedy of mandamus is governed by Rule 65, Section of the Rules of Court, viz.: Section 3.

No. 254757 s ecified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights o the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by r on of the wrongful acts of the respondent. B cause of its nature as an extraordinary remedy, mandamus will lie only if t e following requisites are present: first, the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the act demanded, or those rights which are founded in law, are specific certain, clear, established, complete, undisputed or unquestioned, and are ithout any semblance or color of doubt;97 second, it must be the duty of the d fendant to perform the act, because it is mandated by law; third, the defenda t unlawfully neglects the performance of the duty enjoined by law; fourth, t e act to be performed is ministerial, not discretionary; and, fifth there is no ap eal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course f law.98 C se law provides that a purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer r tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obed ence to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. 99 t connotes an act in which nothing is left to the discretion of the person xecuting it. It is a simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitte or proved to exist and imposed by law.100 If the law imposes a duty upon a ublic officer and gives them the right to decide how or when the duty shall be erformed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministe al only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of offic· al discretion or judgment.101 This notwithstanding, case law settles that ma damus is available to compel action, when refused, on matters involvin discretion, but not to direct the exercise ofj udgment or discretion one way or the other.102 Relevan facts and circumstances governing petition rs ' claim A plying the foregoing concepts and considering the extraordinary nature f the remedy of mandamus, it is pertinent first to highlight several undispu ed facts that are crucial to the resolution of petitioners' claim: (i) the GCG approved the SRA's RATPLAN; 97 Naza~ o v. City ofD umaguete, 601 Phil. 768,800 (2009) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, En Banc). 98 Provin e of Maguindanao de/ Norte v. Bureau of Local Government Finance, G.R. No. 265373, Nove ber 13, 2023 [Per J.

Belmonte, 777 Phil. 169,202 (2016) [Per J. Leonardo-De Castro, En Banc]. 102 Manil Development Authority v. Concerned Residents ofM anila Bay, 595 Phil. 305,326 (2008) [Per J. Velasc , En Banc]. See tzlso Hipos v. Hon. Bay, 600 Phil. 720, 737 (2009) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, Third Divisi ]; Decisio 22 G.R. No. 254757 (ii) the GCG required the SRA to (a) adopt and offer the r tirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the i plementation of the reorganization strengthening, and (b) implement t e new structure and staffing \"within two (2) months after receipt of [ he GCG's approval of the RATPLAN]\"; (iii) petitioners have been retired/separated from their e ployment with the SRA on August 1, 2016 upon availing of the early r tirement incentive program that it (the SRA) offered pursuant to its TPLAN; (iv) petitioners were qualified and complied with the r quirements for availing of the ERIP and had no participation in the i plementation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the ERIP other than a plying for the latter; and (v) petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies to s cure the release of their retirement benefits, all of which proved futile. T ese crucial facts must never be lost in the Court's consideration of petition rs' plea as the sole issue in the Court's resolution of the Petition is whethe petitioners are entitled to the issuance of mandamus to command and expedit the release of their retirement benefits. F r these reasons and by the very nature of the remedy of mandamus, the pro riety of the actions taken in the implementation of the RATPLAN and the ERI will not be the subject of the Court's present disquisition. Verily, any pe ceived error that may have been committed or omitted in the implem ntation of the ERIP should be addressed by the relevant authorities in the roper forum. Regardless, the same has and should not bear any relevan e to petitioners' present plea before the Court for the release of their long ov rdue retirement benefits which the interest of justice and fair play compel the Court to finally and fully resolve. The gra t ofE RIP benefits to petitioners 10154 ensures the \"timely and expeditious release of the retirement pay ... and other benefits of retiring government employees.\" Having spent the bes years of their lives serving the government, these government employ es are assured by the State that they will not be made to wait to receive the benefits due to them under the law. Accordingly, RA 10154 mandat s that \"high priority shall be given to the payment and/or settlement of the ... retirement benefits of retiring government employees.\"103 The '° 3 See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. I. 23 G.R. No. 254757 govern ent employees covered by RA 10154 includes those serving in all branch s of the government, including GOCCs such as the SRA.104 nder Section 2 of the same law, the head of the government agency conce ed is mandated to ensure the release of the retirement pay and other benefit of a retiring government employee within a period of 30 days from the dat of the actual retirement of said employee. The immediate release of the reti ment pay is, however, subject to the condition that \"all requirements are sub itted to the concerned government agency within at least 90 days prior to he effective date of retirement.\" The unjustified failure and/or refusal to rele se the retirement benefits due to a retiring government employee within hese periods shall result in administrative liability, unless the non release of the retirement benefits is due to ''force majeure and other ble causes.\"105 ese prov1s1ons are reiterated in Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013, as amended by Resolution No. 1302242, dated October 1, 2013, hich the CSC issued to implement the provisions of RA 10154, pursuan to Section 6 thereof. In addition, the CSC Resolutions implementing RA 10 54 (IRR), details the responsibilities of the employer-agency, the retiring employees, and the DBM, with respect to the pro~essing of the retirem nt pay of the retiring employee, including the relevant periods governi g the same, as well as the requirements for availing thereof, viz.:106 RULE IV R SPONSIBILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER-AGENCY AND RETIRING EMPLOYEES Section 8. Responsibilities of Employer-Agency. The government a ency where the employee will retire shall: a. Send the retiring employee a letter not later than one (1) year prior to the effectivity of his/her retirement, informing him/her to submit his/her expression of intent to retire as provided under Section 9 hereof, and notifying him/her to submit the necessary requirements at least one hundred (100) days prior to the effectivity date of his/her retirement. Moreover, the employer-agency shall compute the retiree's total number of accumulated years of government service. Should the same be less than fifteen (15) years at the retiree's expected date of retirement, the retiree shall be informed that he/she may request directly before the CSC for the extension of his/her service. For this purpose, the extension of service shall in no case 104 See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. 4. ios See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. 5. 106 See Re olution No. 1300237, Sec. 8 to Sec. IO. Decision 24 G.R. No. 254757 exceed one (1) year and shall be subject to existing civil service laws, rules, and regulations. b. Upon submission of an employee's written intent to retire, provide the retiring employee with the retirement application form, with the accompanying checklist of all the requirements for retirement purposes; c. Upon submission of the requirements, the date of such submission shall be stamp marked on the corresponding item in the retirement application form in clear bold marked, countersigned by the proper receiving and validating employee; d. Process the application for retirement, compute the appropriate retirement benefits, and verify the authenticity, accuracy, and consistency of the data contained in the documents submitted; e. Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the actual date of retirement, endorse to GSIS, [DBM] and other concerned agencies the request of the retiring employee together with the complete set of documentary requirements; f. Submit, as part of its budget proposal to the DBM, a list of its officials and employees who shall compulsorily retire in the next succeeding fiscal year for the latter's incorporation in the Pension and Gratuity Fund; h. Upon receipt of the required funds form the DBM, record and release such funds to the retiring employee within the period prescribed under Section 5. Section 9. Responsibilities of Retiring Employee. The retiring e ployee shall: a. Submit a written expression of intent to retire indicating the desired date of retirement and the retirement package he/she intends to avail at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to his/her actual retirement date; and b. Submit the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the employer-agency not later than one hundred (100) days prior to the actual/intended date of retirement. RULEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE [DBM] Section I 0. Responsibilities of the [DBM]. For terminal leave b nefits and retirement gratuity under . . . Republic Act No. 1616, as a ended, and other relevant laws, the DBM shall perform the following: c. Within one (I) day from receipt of documents, ascertain whether all documents in the prescribed standard list have been Decision 25 G.R. No. 254757 submitted, and if incomplete, immediately call the attention of the employer-agency; d. Within ten ( I 0) days from submission of all documentary requirements, verify the computation, ascertain whether the grant and amount of retirement benefits are in accordance with law, and release the required funds to the employer-agency; Provided, that an additional ten (10) days shall be required if initial findings indicate that a more comprehensive legal due diligence is needed. (Emphasis supplied) S gnificantly, under these provisions, the sole responsibility of the retiring ovemment employee with respect to the release of their retirement benefits is to submit, within the prescribed periods, their written expression of inten to retire and the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the e ployer-agency. Upon their performance thereof, the retiring ent employees have nothing more to do than wait for their retirement thereafter the release of their retirement benefits which should not be 30 days from the actual date of their retirement. Meanwhile, the responsibility for processing and ensuring the timely release f the retirement benefits is primarily lodged with the employer agency d the DBM who, by their nature, holds the relevant power and authorit over the necessary documents and funds for the payment thereof. that the necessary documents and prerequisite steps have been complie with, the tasks to be performed by them, within specified timelines or perio s, in processing the retirement application and retirement benefits are mandat ry leaving no room for discretion. For this reason, the administrative sanctio for the unjustified non-payment of the retirement benefits is imposed only on the officials and/or employees of these agencies who holds the respons • ility of ensuring the timely release of the same. I this case, it is well to recall that in 2015, the SRA formulated the RAT PL to strengthen its organizational structure and capacity to enable it to fulfil the objectives of RA 10659. On April 12, 2016, the GCG approved the S 's RATPLAN under MO No. 2016-05. In the implementation of the RATPL N, the GCG set as conditions, that: (i) the SRA shall \"adopt and offer th retirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the imp mentation oft he organizational strengthening using the incentives provide under EO No. 203;\" and (ii) the new organizational structure and staffing hall be implemented within 2 months after receipt ofM O No. 2016- 05. The incentives referred to in MO No. 2016-05 are found in Section 7 of EO No. 03, series of 2016, viz.: SEC. 7. Early Retirement Incentive Plan (ERIP). - All Officers Employees covered by the CPCS who voluntarily elect to be retired or Decisio 26 G.R. No. 254757 •a y be separated from the service, as part of the performance by GCG of i mandate under Section 5(a) of R.A. No. I 0149 to rationalize, reorganize, erge, or restructure a GOCC, shall be granted the following early r tirement incentive in addition to retirement or separation benefits under e isting laws: Government Service Rates , First 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 20 years and 1 day to 30 years I .25 x BMP x No. of years 30 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years *Basic Monthly Pay (BMP) P rsuant to the foregoing conditions fixed by MO No. 2016-05, the SRA is ued Memorandum IAD-2016-May-003 informing all its employees of the proval of its RA TPLAN and further inviting those who wanted to avail o the ERIP. The SRA likewise set August 1, 2016 as the effective date of sepa ation from the service of those who availed of the ERIP, which include petitioners, to coincide with the two-month period set for the implem ntation of the SRA's new organization structure and staffing, followi g the condition set in MO No. 2016-05. espite their separation from the service on August 1, 2016, however, petition[rs' retirement benefits were not released due to the absence of the require guidelines for the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2016, as require under Section 3 thereof. In the interim, EO No. 36. series of 2017 was iss ed suspending the implementation ofEO No. 203, series of 2016, and concom tantly the issuance of the required guidelines, further delaying the release f petitioners' retirement benefits. T be sure, the Court recognizes that the early retirement package offered o petitioners used the incentives provided under EO No. 203, series of 201 , pursuant to MO No. 2016-05, and for this reason, gives the impress on that the retirement benefits due to petitioners were granted by EO No. 203 series of2016 which, having been suspended and thereafter repealed, have ah~ ady effectively forfeited petitioners' retirement benefits. T is impression aside, the Court is of the view that it was actually the RATPL N, which the GCG approved pursuant to the powers granted to it under S ction 5(a) of RA 10149-and not EO No. 203, series of2016-which formed he basis for the implementation of the early retirement package offered o petitioners. To emphasize, MO No. 2016-05, which approved the SRA's TPLAN, required the adoption and offering of retirement and separati n package for the affected personnel in recognition of the reality that the rear anization of the SRA would necessarily entail declaring certain position as redundant and concomitantly, the voluntary/involuntary separati n/retirement of certain employees from the service. Thus, to the Court's ind, the reference to EO No. 203, series of 2016 with respect to the Decision 27 G.R. No. 254757 retirem nt package to be offered to the affected SRA employees was made pursu t to State policy of standardizing the compensation of government official and employees, including those in the GOCCs. In other words, EO No. 20 , series of 2016 was referenced to serve merely as basis for the determi ation and computation of the amount of the retirement benefits due to eac retiring employee of the SRA. Accordingly, petitioners having comp Ii d with the requirements of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the r tirement and separation package offered in the implementation of the RA TP N, they have become entitled by law and equity to the corresponding retirem nt benefits. this regard, it should be borne in mind that the authority to determine a GOCC should be reorganized and-upon \"its determination that it best interest of the State that a GOCC should be reorganized\"-to the corresponding reorganization plan and early retirement incentive progr is lodged with the GCG pursuant to Section S(a) of RA 10149. Having pproved the SRA's RATPLAN, the same signified as an imprimatur by the tate, through the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid a lawful. Consequently, the absence of the implementing guidelines of EO o. 203, series of 2016, as well as the subsequent suspension thereof by EO o. 36, series of 2017, are not sufficient bases to deny petitioners their retirem nt benefits. tably, on October 11, 2021, EO No. 150, series of 2021 was issued approvi g and providing for the new CPCS and Index of Occupational Service, Position Titles, and Job Grades for GOCCs (IOS-G) Framework, thereby epealing EO No. 203, series of 2016. Subsequently, on January 12, 2022, t e GCG issued Guidelines No. 2021-001 to implement EO No. 150, series o 2021. Relevantly, Section 13 of EO No. 150, series of 2021, like Section 7 of EO No. 203, series of 2021, similarly authorizes the GCG, pursuan to Section 5(a) of RA 10149, \"to grant an [ERIP] to officers and employ es who voluntarily elect to be retired\" in accordance with the rates provide under Section 12, viz.: Government Service Rates irst 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 0 years and 1 day to 30 years 1.25 x BMP x No. of years 0 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years * asic Monthly Pay (BMP) oreover, the rates provided under Section 12 of EO No. 150, series of 2021 ar largely similar to those provided under Section 7 of EO No. 203, series o 2016. What evidently differs is the basic monthly pay from which shall be omputed the total amount of the retirement benefits which a retiring employ e shall receive. 28 G.R. No. 254757 his notwithstanding, and while there appears to be no explicit statem nt under EO No. 150, series of 2021 providing for its retroactive applica ion, the Court finds no justifiable and equitable reason not to consider the iss ance of EO No. 150, series of 2021 and its implementing guidelines as the emoval or cessation of the \"insuperable cause\" that prevented the release fpetitioners' retirement benefits to which they had long been entitled pursu t to the implementation of the RATPLAN. To rule otherwise would only le ve petitioners' claim indefinitely unresolved. Verily, the dictates of justice d equity call for an equitable resolution to petitioners' situation who has so ar not found relief in the various measures taken by them. quity, as the complement of legal jurisdiction, seeks to reach and do comp le e justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their rules and wa t of power to adapt their judgments to the special circumstances of cases, e incompetent to do so. \"Equity regards the spirit and not the letter, the inte t and not the form, the substance rather than the circumstance, as it is various y expressed by different courts.\"107 In the exercise of its equity jurisdic ion, the Court may adjust the rights of parties in accordance with the circum tances obtaining at the time of rendition of judgment, when these are signific ntly different from those existing at the time of generation of those rights.1 8 ccordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the Court, in the exercis of its equity jurisdiction, rules that petitioners are entitled to the payme of their retirement benefits which respondents the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM must determine, process, and facilitate with due dispatch. It must b emphasized herein that the Court, in making this declaration, is not directin the exercise of respondents' discretion one way or the other. Rather, the Cou is directing respondents to perform their respective mandated duties under 10154 and other relevant laws and rules. Evidently, matters relating to the s urce of the budget for the payment of petitioners' retirement benefits, the co utation thereof, the procedure for the release of the same, and other relevan details is subject to the respondents' discretion in the exercise of their respecti e powers and mandates. summary, the GCG's approval of the SRA's RATPLAN, in the of its discretion under RA 10149, signified as an imprimatur by the State, t ough the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid and law I. The early retirement package offered to petitioners and which they availed of was adopted pursuant to this approved RATPLAN. Upon their separati n from the service on August 1, 2016 and having complied with the require ents of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the retirement and sep ration package offered in the implementation of the RATPLAN, '° 1 Hacie da Luisita, Incorporated v.

Morea er, under RA 10154, the responsibility for processing, within specified periods or timelines and prerequisite steps, and ensuring the timely release of the peti ioners' retirement benefits are primarily lodged with the SRA and the DBM. Final final word. The Court's present disposition must be considered in the light of he surrounding circumstances of this case that has left petitioners with neither heir employment with the SRA nor the retirement benefits to which they ar entitled. As it is, petitioners' separation from the service is a fait accom i that can no longer be rectified by a misdirected emphasis and an obstina e insistence on the invalidity of the actions taken in the implem ntation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the corresponding early retirem nt package. Regardless of the various reasons that prevented the timely ffl ease of the retirement benefits, it is undisputed that petitioners have served t e government and have subsequently voluntarily retired therefrom to pave t e way for the SRA's reorganization. Clearly, no reasonable and justifia le objection can be made to further deny petitioners their retirement benefits which they are clearly entitled under the law.

Since the RATPLAN was formulated pursuant to EO No. 203, series o 2016 and RA 10149, and petitioners' separation/retirement from the SRA w s made pursuant thereto, their separation from the service cannot be conside ed illegal under the Constitution.

No comment was filed by or o behalf of the SRA. n October 11, 2021, petitioners filed a Manifestation47 informing the Court t at on October 1, 2021, EO No. 150, series of 2021 was issued approvi g the CPCS and Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles, and Job gr es for GOCCs (IOS-G) Framework and asserting that with the issuanc, thereof, \"there is no longer any impediment in the implementation of [their] RIP.\" Thus, they pray that the same be given by the Court judicial notice fi r the expeditious resolution of the petition.

The Case Before the Court titioners argue that they have a clear and unmistakable right for the release nd payment of their ERIP benefits and there is no other plain, speedy, and ade uate remedy in the ordinary course oflaw. Petitioners assert that with the pa ial implementation of the SRA's RATPLAN resulting in their separati n from the service affective August 1, 2016, they acquired a clear and u istakable right to the ERIP benefits which was offered and which they availed fpursuant to the approved RATPLAN.54 ongruently, petitioners claim that respondents unlawfully neglected the perfi rmance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. In this respect, petitioners point out that under Section 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 10154, the retirem nt benefits of retiring government employees shall be released to them w thin thirty days from their actual retirement date. While the running of the 0-day period can be tolled, the same can be justified only upon occurre ce off orce majeure or other insuperable circumstances.55 their case, petitioners claim that after receiving the funds intended ayment of their ERIP benefits from the DBM, the SRA has no other option ut to comply with its ministerial duty to release and pay the same pursuan to the IRR of RA 10154. As for the GCG, petitioners contend that the latt has no authority to advice the SRA to withhold the payment of the ERIP b nefits, notwithstanding the issuance of EO No. 36, series of 2017, because of the mandatory nature of the early release of the retirement benefits under 10154, and because EO No. 36, series of 2017, being prospective, covers nly government employees starting 2017 onwards. 56 F nally, petitioners underscore that despite their separation from the n August 1, 2016 and their numerous efforts to follow-up on the and release of the ERIP benefits, including the finality of the CSC directing the SRA to release the same, as well as their letters and appeal t the GCG and the OP which to date remain unanswered, they have yet to r ceive their ERIP benefits. Thus, they argue that they are left with no 54 Id. at 9-32. 55 Id. at 3 -35. 56 Id. Decision 11 G.R. No. 254757 recours but to file the present petition for mandamus before the Court to: (i) declare he ERIP to be valid and enforceable; (ii) declare GCG MC No. 2017- 03, whi h suspended their ERIP, as contrary to law; and (iii) \"command all respond nts to immediately pay and release their ERIP benefits with acceler ed dispatch. \"57 I their Comment,58 respondents GCG and DBM, through the OSG, primarilr argued that the Petition still suffers from fatal defects, despite the opportu ity given to petitioners to correct the same, and the filing thereof directly before the Court, violated the hierarchy of courts principle. Specifi lly, the OSG highlights the following defects in the petition: (a) the certific ion against forum shopping is not signed by all petitioners; (b) the Petition contains a false certification against forum shopping by stating that they ha e not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues a d that to the best of their knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending since as admitted, thirty-four of them filed before the Ombudsman a complai t involving the same issues; and (c) that the Petition does not specify the nam of all petitioners59 in the caption.60 Lastly, the OSG claims that the petition should have been filed before the Regional Trial Court-which has concurr nt jurisdiction over petitions for mandamus-and that the petition requires a determination of a question of fact, i.e., whether the requirements for the elease of their ERIP benefits have been complied with, which the Court c nnot resolve, it not being a trier of facts.61 n the merits, the OSG asserts that while petitioners are entitled to any benefits that may be due them under existing laws and rules, they nonetheless, failed t point out a clear legal right on their part to demand the release of their E P benefits and the corresponding ministerial duty on the part of the GCG a d the DBM to release the same that would justify the issuance of a writ of andamus. ·rstly, the OSG points out that petitioners' ERIP benefits are based on the S 's RATPLAN which was formulated and approved pursuant to EO No. 203, series of 2016. EO No. 203, series of 2016, however, required, as a precon •t ion for the computation and release of the ERIP benefits, the issuanc by the GCG of the corresponding implementing guidelines-which require ent the SRA ignored by setting the effectivity date of petitioners' early re irement on August 1, 2016 despite the GCG's reminders.63 51 Id. at 5-40. 58 Id. at 02-116. 59 Id. at 92.

Decision 12 G.R. No. 254757 orse, the OSG argues that the SRA implemented the RA TPLAN prior to the BM' s resolution of the former' s request tbr the inclusion in its 2016 Corpor te Operating Budget (COB) the needed amount for the payment of the ERIP b nefits which, lamentably, the DBM was constrained to deny for the same re son that the needed implementing guidelines for EO No. 203, series of 201 had not yet been issued. 64 Compounding the situation was the issuanc of EO No. 36, series of 2017, and the corresponding implementing guideli es under MC No. 2017-03, which suspended the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2017, including the provision on the ERIP.65 Parenth tically, the OSG argues that the subsequent issuance of EO No. 150, series f 2021 does not affect petitioners' case since the same applies prospec ively.66 S condly, the OSG counters petitioners' reliance on RA 10154 by pointin out that the mandatory release of the retirement benefits within the 30-day eriod is subject to the proviso that all the \"requirements are submitted to the c ncerned government agency at least 90 days prior to the effective date of retire\\ ent.\" In petitioners' case, this condition has not been complied with since th SRA submitted its request for supplemental budget with the DBM only on June 22, 2016 or 45 days before the effective date of petitioners' retirem nt on August 1, 2016.67 ·nally, the OSG asserts that the GCG and the DBM's respective duties with r spect to the retirement benefits of retired/retiring government employ es are discretionary, not ministerial. It argues that nowhere in RA 10149 •s it provided that the GCG has a ministerial duty to release the retirem nt benefits to GOCCs. At most, it has the duty to implement the SRA's eorganization plan, which covers petitioners' ERIP benefits. This duty, h wever, is discretionary since EO No. 203, series of 2016 specifically gave th GCG the authority to decide the requirements for and the details of the exe ution of the ERIP. Moreover, RA 10149 qualified the GCG's duty to implem nt the reorganization of GOCCs by a· contrary directive of the Preside t. In petitioners' case, the implementation of the SRA's RA TPLAN, includi g the payment of the ERIP benefits, was qualified by the contrary directiv of the President under EO No. 36, series of 2017 suspending the implem ntation of EO No. 203, series of2016.68 nent the DBM, the OSG points out that under the GCG Memorandum 2012-0 , the DBM has the duty to evaluate the annual budgetary support to GOCCs and evaluate and approve the annual COB of GOCCs, while under Rule V, Section l0(e) of the CSC Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013 i plementing RA 10154, the DBM has the duty to verify the 64 Id. at 00-201. 65 Id. at 01-202. 66 Id. at 88. 61 Id. at 02-203. 68 Id. at 03-205. 13 G.R. No. 254757 comput tion and ascertainment of whether the grant and amount of retirement benefit are in accordance with the law, among others. 69 their Reply70 to the GCG and the DBM's Comment, petitioners primari y claim the failure to include in the petition's caption of the names of some etitioners was due to mere inadvertence and at any rate, these petition rs signed the verification and certification of non-forum shopping which rms part of the body of the Petition. In this regard, petitioners invoke relaxati n of the strict application of the rules in the interest of justice and in view o the special and compelling circumstances of this case involving retired civil servants who have long been deprived of their retirement benefit .71 dditionally, petitioners argue that they did not commit forum shoppi nor was the certification they signed was falsified since the parties and cau es of action in the case filed before the Ombudsman and the present petition are different. 72 They likewise claim that their case presents special and co pelling reasons that justify direct recourse before the Court. 73 I L stly, anent the merits, petitioners maintain that they have a clear and unmista able right for the release and payment of their ERIP benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof. 74 The Issue Before the Court T e issue before the Court is whether mandamus should be issued against espondents to compel the release of petitioners' retirement benefits The Court's Ruling T e Petition is partly meritorious. I. the outset, the OSG, on behalf of GCG and DBM, prays for the outright dismissal of the Petition since (i) it was purportedly filed in violation of the h erarchy of courts and (ii)-the certification of non-forum shopping is not sig ed by all petitioners and that the same contains false certification 69 Id. 70 Id. at 312-328. 71 Id. at 314-317. 72 Id. at 3 7-318. 13 Id. at 3 7-318. 14 Id. at 3 8-325.

T e principle or doctrine of hierarchy of courts recognizes the jurisdic •o n and the various levels of courts in the country as they are establis ed under the Constitution and by law, and their relationship with one another. 5 It guides litigants as to the proper venue of appeals and/or the approp ate forum for the issuance of extraordinary writs. 76 It recognizes, too, the prac ical need to restrain parties from directly resorting to the Court when relief m y be obtained before the lower courts in order to prevent \"'inordinate demand upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters ithin its exclusive jurisdiction,' as well as to prevent the congestion of the ourt's dockets,\"77 and prevent the inevitable and resultant delay, intende or otherwise, in the adjudication of cases which often have to be remand d or referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of procedu e, or as the court better equipped to resolve factual questions.78 U der the Constitution's structure, the Supreme Court is designated as the high st court with irreducible powers, 79 whose rulings serve as precedents that oth r courts must follow because they form part of the law of the land.

These cases may ult mately reach the Supreme Court through the medium of an appeal or certior ri.82 Considering that jurisdiction and the leveling of the courts are defined by law, the hierarchy should leave very little opening for flexibility ( and po ential legal questions), except for the fact that the law has conferred concurr ntjurisdictions for certain cases or remedies to courts at different and defined levels. Petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and ha eas corpus, fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the regional trial courts a d the higher courts, including the Supreme Court. 83 Thus, parties are, as a ru e, required to file these petitions before the lower-ranked court; otherwi e, the petition may be dismissed outright. 84 onetheless, there are recognized exceptions to the general rule.

N otabl , there is no dispute that petitioners retired/separated from the SRA on August , 2016 pursuant to the ERIP that it offered to facilitate its RAT PLAN which t e GCG approved. Despite their retirement/separation on August 1, 2016, p titioners have not received any retirement benefits from the SRA to date- hich fact likewise remains undisputed. From the time they retired from th SRA, petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies before the SRA, th GCG and even before the OP, among others, to secure the release of their retirement benefits-all of which proved futile.

Neither have there b en any significant action taken on the part of respondents and/or relevant other government agencies to address petitioners' concerns.

No. 254757 sever~l of them have filed a complaint before the Ombudsman involving the same 1s ues. ule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, as further amended, states that \"the pl intiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other i itiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certific tion annexed thereto and simultaneous~y filed therewith: a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same is ues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his kno ledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status t ereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action r claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) alendar days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initi tory pleading has been filed.\" The failure of the plaintiff or principal party to comply therewith \"shall not be curable by mere amendment of the compla\"nt or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice.\" Thus, as a rule, all the plaintiff or principal parties to a cas must sign the certification of non-forum shopping, failing in which will wa ant the dismissal of the case. owever, in Altres v. Empleo,91 the Court held that the failure of the otherp itioners to sign the certification of non-forum shopping for justifiable reasons should not result in the outright dismissal of the case. Verily, the signing of the certification by more than a majority of the petitioners, as in this cas , \"already sufficiently assures the Court that the allegations in the pleadin are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of spec lation; that the pleading is filed in good faith; and that the signatories are unq estionably real parties-in-interest who undoubtedly have sufficient knowle ge and belief to swear to the truth of the allegations in the petition.\"92 To prov de guidance for the bench, the bar, and the public, the Court inAltres further summarized the guidelines found in case law respecting non compli ce with the requirements on, or submission of defective, verification and cert fication of non-forum shopping, viz.: For the guidance of the bench and bar, the Court restates in capsule the jurisprudential pronouncements already reflected above respecting n n-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of defective, v rification and certification against forum shopping: I) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the r uirement on or submission ofd efective verification, and non-compliance w th the requirement on or submission of defective certification against ~ m shopping. 91 594 P ·1. 246 (2008) [Per J. Carpio Morales, En Banc]. 92 Id. at 0. Decision 19 G.R. No. 254757 2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein d es not necessarily render the· pleading fatally defective. The court may o der its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending c cumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be d spensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby. 3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one o has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the c mplaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the p tition have been made in good faith or are true and correct. 4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance t erewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not c rable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the round of \"substantial com liance\" resence of \"s ecial circumstances or com ellin reasons.\" 5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by a the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not si n will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or • stifiable circumstances however as when all the laintiffs or titioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of a tion or defense the si nature of onl one of them in the certification a ainst forum sho in substantiall com lies with the Rule. 6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be e ecuted by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for re sonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must e ecute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to on his behalf. 93 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) re, petitioners undoubtedly share a common interest and invoke a comma cause of action, i.e., the release of their long-awaited ERIP benefits which t ey availed of pursuant to the SRA's RATPLAN which they have yet to recei e despite their separation from the service since 2016. Under these circums ances, petitioners' substantial compliance with the requirements of the rule and the presence of special and compelling reasons should not merit the out •g ht dismissal of their petition without defeating the administration of justice. F nally, the alleged false certification must be brushed aside for lack of merit. petitioners aptly argued, the parties and causes of action in the case filed be re the Ombudsman and the present Petition are different. Indeed, the complai t before the Ombudsman was filed against the administrator94 of the SRA an , while praying for the release of their ERIP benefits, essentially sought t hold the latter liable for non-compliance with the CSC's Decision and for iolation of RA 10154 and Section 5(a) of RA 6713. In contrast, the present etition filed against the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM ultimately 93 Id. at 2 1-262; citations omitted. 94 Specifi ally named as respondent was SRA Administrator Hermenigildo R. Serafica; rollo, p. 63. 20 G.R. No. 254757 Decisiol seeks t compel these government agencies to release their ERIP benefits which t ey purportedly have negligently failed to do so. 11 told, petitioners' substantial compliance and the surrounding circum tances of the case justify the relaxation of the procedural rules in the broader interest ofj ustice. II. P oceeding to the merits oft he petition, petitioners argue that they have a clear nd unmistakable right for the release and payment of their retirement benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof and wh~ch respondents unlawfully neglected to perform. The GCG and the DBM, n the other hand, assert that petitioners failed to point out a clear legal right o their part to demand the release of these benefits and the corresp nding ministerial duty on the part oft he GCG and the DBM to release the sam . nd concept ofm andamus andamus is a command issuing from a court of law of competent jurisdic •o n, in the name of the state or sovereign, directed to some in erior court, tribunal, or board, or to some corporation or person, equiring the performance of a particular duty therein specified, which duty res Its from the official station of the party to whom the writ is directed, or from peration of law. It is an extraordinary remedy issued only in cases of extreme necessity where the ordinary course of procedure is powerless to afford adequate and speedy relief to one who has a clear legal right to the perform nee of the act to be compelled.95 Moreover, its principal function is to com and and to expedite, not to inquire and to adjudicate96 U1 der our Rules, the remedy of mandamus is governed by Rule 65, Section of the Rules of Court, viz.: Section 3. Petition for mandamus. - When any tribunal, oration, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance o an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an o ce, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and e •o yment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no ot er plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the p son aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, al eging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered c mantling the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be 95 Specia People, Inc.

No. 254757 s ecified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights o the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by r on of the wrongful acts of the respondent. B cause of its nature as an extraordinary remedy, mandamus will lie only if t e following requisites are present: first, the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the act demanded, or those rights which are founded in law, are specific certain, clear, established, complete, undisputed or unquestioned, and are ithout any semblance or color of doubt;97 second, it must be the duty of the d fendant to perform the act, because it is mandated by law; third, the defenda t unlawfully neglects the performance of the duty enjoined by law; fourth, t e act to be performed is ministerial, not discretionary; and, fifth there is no ap eal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course f law.98 C se law provides that a purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer r tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obed ence to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. 99 t connotes an act in which nothing is left to the discretion of the person xecuting it. It is a simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitte or proved to exist and imposed by law.100 If the law imposes a duty upon a ublic officer and gives them the right to decide how or when the duty shall be erformed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministe al only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of offic· al discretion or judgment.101 This notwithstanding, case law settles that ma damus is available to compel action, when refused, on matters involvin discretion, but not to direct the exercise ofj udgment or discretion one way or the other.102 Relevan facts and circumstances governing petition rs ' claim A plying the foregoing concepts and considering the extraordinary nature f the remedy of mandamus, it is pertinent first to highlight several undispu ed facts that are crucial to the resolution of petitioners' claim: (i) the GCG approved the SRA's RATPLAN; 97 Naza~ o v. City ofD umaguete, 601 Phil. 768,800 (2009) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, En Banc). 98 Provin e of Maguindanao de/ Norte v. Bureau of Local Government Finance, G.R. No. 265373, Nove ber 13, 2023 [Per J.

See tzlso Hipos v. Hon. Bay, 600 Phil. 720, 737 (2009) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, Third Divisi ]; Decisio 22 G.R. No. 254757 (ii) the GCG required the SRA to (a) adopt and offer the r tirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the i plementation of the reorganization strengthening, and (b) implement t e new structure and staffing \"within two (2) months after receipt of [ he GCG's approval of the RATPLAN]\"; (iii) petitioners have been retired/separated from their e ployment with the SRA on August 1, 2016 upon availing of the early r tirement incentive program that it (the SRA) offered pursuant to its TPLAN; (iv) petitioners were qualified and complied with the r quirements for availing of the ERIP and had no participation in the i plementation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the ERIP other than a plying for the latter; and (v) petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies to s cure the release of their retirement benefits, all of which proved futile. T ese crucial facts must never be lost in the Court's consideration of petition rs' plea as the sole issue in the Court's resolution of the Petition is whethe petitioners are entitled to the issuance of mandamus to command and expedit the release of their retirement benefits. F r these reasons and by the very nature of the remedy of mandamus, the pro riety of the actions taken in the implementation of the RATPLAN and the ERI will not be the subject of the Court's present disquisition. Verily, any pe ceived error that may have been committed or omitted in the implem ntation of the ERIP should be addressed by the relevant authorities in the roper forum. Regardless, the same has and should not bear any relevan e to petitioners' present plea before the Court for the release of their long ov rdue retirement benefits which the interest of justice and fair play compel the Court to finally and fully resolve. The gra t ofE RIP benefits to petitioners 10154 ensures the \"timely and expeditious release of the retirement pay ... and other benefits of retiring government employees.\" Having spent the bes years of their lives serving the government, these government employ es are assured by the State that they will not be made to wait to receive the benefits due to them under the law. Accordingly, RA 10154 mandat s that \"high priority shall be given to the payment and/or settlement of the ... retirement benefits of retiring government employees.\"103 The '° 3 See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. I. 23 G.R. No. 254757 govern ent employees covered by RA 10154 includes those serving in all branch s of the government, including GOCCs such as the SRA.104 nder Section 2 of the same law, the head of the government agency conce ed is mandated to ensure the release of the retirement pay and other benefit of a retiring government employee within a period of 30 days from the dat of the actual retirement of said employee. The immediate release of the reti ment pay is, however, subject to the condition that \"all requirements are sub itted to the concerned government agency within at least 90 days prior to he effective date of retirement.\" The unjustified failure and/or refusal to rele se the retirement benefits due to a retiring government employee within hese periods shall result in administrative liability, unless the non release of the retirement benefits is due to ''force majeure and other ble causes.\"105 ese prov1s1ons are reiterated in Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013, as amended by Resolution No. 1302242, dated October 1, 2013, hich the CSC issued to implement the provisions of RA 10154, pursuan to Section 6 thereof. In addition, the CSC Resolutions implementing RA 10 54 (IRR), details the responsibilities of the employer-agency, the retiring employees, and the DBM, with respect to the pro~essing of the retirem nt pay of the retiring employee, including the relevant periods governi g the same, as well as the requirements for availing thereof, viz.:106 RULE IV R SPONSIBILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER-AGENCY AND RETIRING EMPLOYEES Section 8. Responsibilities of Employer-Agency. The government a ency where the employee will retire shall: a. Send the retiring employee a letter not later than one (1) year prior to the effectivity of his/her retirement, informing him/her to submit his/her expression of intent to retire as provided under Section 9 hereof, and notifying him/her to submit the necessary requirements at least one hundred (100) days prior to the effectivity date of his/her retirement. Moreover, the employer-agency shall compute the retiree's total number of accumulated years of government service. Should the same be less than fifteen (15) years at the retiree's expected date of retirement, the retiree shall be informed that he/she may request directly before the CSC for the extension of his/her service. For this purpose, the extension of service shall in no case 104 See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. 4. ios See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. 5. 106 See Re olution No. 1300237, Sec. 8 to Sec. IO.

Upon submission of an employee's written intent to retire, provide the retiring employee with the retirement application form, with the accompanying checklist of all the requirements for retirement purposes; c. Upon submission of the requirements, the date of such submission shall be stamp marked on the corresponding item in the retirement application form in clear bold marked, countersigned by the proper receiving and validating employee; d. Process the application for retirement, compute the appropriate retirement benefits, and verify the authenticity, accuracy, and consistency of the data contained in the documents submitted; e. Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the actual date of retirement, endorse to GSIS, [DBM] and other concerned agencies the request of the retiring employee together with the complete set of documentary requirements; f. Submit, as part of its budget proposal to the DBM, a list of its officials and employees who shall compulsorily retire in the next succeeding fiscal year for the latter's incorporation in the Pension and Gratuity Fund; h. Upon receipt of the required funds form the DBM, record and release such funds to the retiring employee within the period prescribed under Section 5. Section 9. Responsibilities of Retiring Employee. The retiring e ployee shall: a. Submit a written expression of intent to retire indicating the desired date of retirement and the retirement package he/she intends to avail at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to his/her actual retirement date; and b. Submit the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the employer-agency not later than one hundred (100) days prior to the actual/intended date of retirement. RULEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE [DBM] Section I 0. Responsibilities of the [DBM]. For terminal leave b nefits and retirement gratuity under . . . Republic Act No. 1616, as a ended, and other relevant laws, the DBM shall perform the following: c. Within one (I) day from receipt of documents, ascertain whether all documents in the prescribed standard list have been Decision 25 G.R. No. 254757 submitted, and if incomplete, immediately call the attention of the employer-agency; d. Within ten ( I 0) days from submission of all documentary requirements, verify the computation, ascertain whether the grant and amount of retirement benefits are in accordance with law, and release the required funds to the employer-agency; Provided, that an additional ten (10) days shall be required if initial findings indicate that a more comprehensive legal due diligence is needed. (Emphasis supplied) S gnificantly, under these provisions, the sole responsibility of the retiring ovemment employee with respect to the release of their retirement benefits is to submit, within the prescribed periods, their written expression of inten to retire and the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the e ployer-agency. Upon their performance thereof, the retiring ent employees have nothing more to do than wait for their retirement thereafter the release of their retirement benefits which should not be 30 days from the actual date of their retirement. Meanwhile, the responsibility for processing and ensuring the timely release f the retirement benefits is primarily lodged with the employer agency d the DBM who, by their nature, holds the relevant power and authorit over the necessary documents and funds for the payment thereof. that the necessary documents and prerequisite steps have been complie with, the tasks to be performed by them, within specified timelines or perio s, in processing the retirement application and retirement benefits are mandat ry leaving no room for discretion. For this reason, the administrative sanctio for the unjustified non-payment of the retirement benefits is imposed only on the officials and/or employees of these agencies who holds the respons • ility of ensuring the timely release of the same. I this case, it is well to recall that in 2015, the SRA formulated the RAT PL to strengthen its organizational structure and capacity to enable it to fulfil the objectives of RA 10659. On April 12, 2016, the GCG approved the S 's RATPLAN under MO No. 2016-05. In the implementation of the RATPL N, the GCG set as conditions, that: (i) the SRA shall \"adopt and offer th retirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the imp mentation oft he organizational strengthening using the incentives provide under EO No. 203;\" and (ii) the new organizational structure and staffing hall be implemented within 2 months after receipt ofM O No. 2016- 05. The incentives referred to in MO No. 2016-05 are found in Section 7 of EO No. 03, series of 2016, viz.: SEC. 7. Early Retirement Incentive Plan (ERIP). - All Officers Employees covered by the CPCS who voluntarily elect to be retired or Decisio 26 G.R. No. 254757 •a y be separated from the service, as part of the performance by GCG of i mandate under Section 5(a) of R.A. No. I 0149 to rationalize, reorganize, erge, or restructure a GOCC, shall be granted the following early r tirement incentive in addition to retirement or separation benefits under e isting laws: Government Service Rates , First 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 20 years and 1 day to 30 years I .25 x BMP x No. of years 30 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years *Basic Monthly Pay (BMP) P rsuant to the foregoing conditions fixed by MO No. 2016-05, the SRA is ued Memorandum IAD-2016-May-003 informing all its employees of the proval of its RA TPLAN and further inviting those who wanted to avail o the ERIP. The SRA likewise set August 1, 2016 as the effective date of sepa ation from the service of those who availed of the ERIP, which include petitioners, to coincide with the two-month period set for the implem ntation of the SRA's new organization structure and staffing, followi g the condition set in MO No. 2016-05. espite their separation from the service on August 1, 2016, however, petition[rs' retirement benefits were not released due to the absence of the require guidelines for the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2016, as require under Section 3 thereof. In the interim, EO No. 36. series of 2017 was iss ed suspending the implementation ofEO No. 203, series of 2016, and concom tantly the issuance of the required guidelines, further delaying the release f petitioners' retirement benefits. T be sure, the Court recognizes that the early retirement package offered o petitioners used the incentives provided under EO No. 203, series of 201 , pursuant to MO No. 2016-05, and for this reason, gives the impress on that the retirement benefits due to petitioners were granted by EO No. 203 series of2016 which, having been suspended and thereafter repealed, have ah~ ady effectively forfeited petitioners' retirement benefits. T is impression aside, the Court is of the view that it was actually the RATPL N, which the GCG approved pursuant to the powers granted to it under S ction 5(a) of RA 10149-and not EO No. 203, series of2016-which formed he basis for the implementation of the early retirement package offered o petitioners. To emphasize, MO No. 2016-05, which approved the SRA's TPLAN, required the adoption and offering of retirement and separati n package for the affected personnel in recognition of the reality that the rear anization of the SRA would necessarily entail declaring certain position as redundant and concomitantly, the voluntary/involuntary separati n/retirement of certain employees from the service. Thus, to the Court's ind, the reference to EO No. 203, series of 2016 with respect to the Decision 27 G.R. No. 254757 retirem nt package to be offered to the affected SRA employees was made pursu t to State policy of standardizing the compensation of government official and employees, including those in the GOCCs. In other words, EO No. 20 , series of 2016 was referenced to serve merely as basis for the determi ation and computation of the amount of the retirement benefits due to eac retiring employee of the SRA. Accordingly, petitioners having comp Ii d with the requirements of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the r tirement and separation package offered in the implementation of the RA TP N, they have become entitled by law and equity to the corresponding retirem nt benefits. this regard, it should be borne in mind that the authority to determine a GOCC should be reorganized and-upon \"its determination that it best interest of the State that a GOCC should be reorganized\"-to the corresponding reorganization plan and early retirement incentive progr is lodged with the GCG pursuant to Section S(a) of RA 10149. Having pproved the SRA's RATPLAN, the same signified as an imprimatur by the tate, through the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid a lawful. Consequently, the absence of the implementing guidelines of EO o. 203, series of 2016, as well as the subsequent suspension thereof by EO o. 36, series of 2017, are not sufficient bases to deny petitioners their retirem nt benefits. tably, on October 11, 2021, EO No. 150, series of 2021 was issued approvi g and providing for the new CPCS and Index of Occupational Service, Position Titles, and Job Grades for GOCCs (IOS-G) Framework, thereby epealing EO No. 203, series of 2016. Subsequently, on January 12, 2022, t e GCG issued Guidelines No. 2021-001 to implement EO No. 150, series o 2021. Relevantly, Section 13 of EO No. 150, series of 2021, like Section 7 of EO No. 203, series of 2021, similarly authorizes the GCG, pursuan to Section 5(a) of RA 10149, \"to grant an [ERIP] to officers and employ es who voluntarily elect to be retired\" in accordance with the rates provide under Section 12, viz.: Government Service Rates irst 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 0 years and 1 day to 30 years 1.25 x BMP x No. of years 0 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years * asic Monthly Pay (BMP) oreover, the rates provided under Section 12 of EO No. 150, series of 2021 ar largely similar to those provided under Section 7 of EO No. 203, series o 2016. What evidently differs is the basic monthly pay from which shall be omputed the total amount of the retirement benefits which a retiring employ e shall receive. 28 G.R. No. 254757 his notwithstanding, and while there appears to be no explicit statem nt under EO No. 150, series of 2021 providing for its retroactive applica ion, the Court finds no justifiable and equitable reason not to consider the iss ance of EO No. 150, series of 2021 and its implementing guidelines as the emoval or cessation of the \"insuperable cause\" that prevented the release fpetitioners' retirement benefits to which they had long been entitled pursu t to the implementation of the RATPLAN. To rule otherwise would only le ve petitioners' claim indefinitely unresolved. Verily, the dictates of justice d equity call for an equitable resolution to petitioners' situation who has so ar not found relief in the various measures taken by them. quity, as the complement of legal jurisdiction, seeks to reach and do comp le e justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their rules and wa t of power to adapt their judgments to the special circumstances of cases, e incompetent to do so. \"Equity regards the spirit and not the letter, the inte t and not the form, the substance rather than the circumstance, as it is various y expressed by different courts.\"107 In the exercise of its equity jurisdic ion, the Court may adjust the rights of parties in accordance with the circum tances obtaining at the time of rendition of judgment, when these are signific ntly different from those existing at the time of generation of those rights.1 8 ccordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the Court, in the exercis of its equity jurisdiction, rules that petitioners are entitled to the payme of their retirement benefits which respondents the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM must determine, process, and facilitate with due dispatch. It must b emphasized herein that the Court, in making this declaration, is not directin the exercise of respondents' discretion one way or the other. Rather, the Cou is directing respondents to perform their respective mandated duties under 10154 and other relevant laws and rules. Evidently, matters relating to the s urce of the budget for the payment of petitioners' retirement benefits, the co utation thereof, the procedure for the release of the same, and other relevan details is subject to the respondents' discretion in the exercise of their respecti e powers and mandates. summary, the GCG's approval of the SRA's RATPLAN, in the of its discretion under RA 10149, signified as an imprimatur by the State, t ough the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid and law I. The early retirement package offered to petitioners and which they availed of was adopted pursuant to this approved RATPLAN. Upon their separati n from the service on August 1, 2016 and having complied with the require ents of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the retirement and sep ration package offered in the implementation of the RATPLAN, '° 1 Hacie da Luisita, Incorporated v.

Morea er, under RA 10154, the responsibility for processing, within specified periods or timelines and prerequisite steps, and ensuring the timely release of the peti ioners' retirement benefits are primarily lodged with the SRA and the DBM. Final final word. The Court's present disposition must be considered in the light of he surrounding circumstances of this case that has left petitioners with neither heir employment with the SRA nor the retirement benefits to which they ar entitled. As it is, petitioners' separation from the service is a fait accom i that can no longer be rectified by a misdirected emphasis and an obstina e insistence on the invalidity of the actions taken in the implem ntation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the corresponding early retirem nt package. Regardless of the various reasons that prevented the timely ffl ease of the retirement benefits, it is undisputed that petitioners have served t e government and have subsequently voluntarily retired therefrom to pave t e way for the SRA's reorganization. Clearly, no reasonable and justifia le objection can be made to further deny petitioners their retirement benefits which they are clearly entitled under the law.

Since the RATPLAN was formulated pursuant to EO No. 203, series o 2016 and RA 10149, and petitioners' separation/retirement from the SRA w s made pursuant thereto, their separation from the service cannot be conside ed illegal under the Constitution. Consequently, the non payme t/non-receipt of the retirement/separation pay and other benefits will not ren er illegal the otherwise legal cause of their separation. 24 In view thereof, the CSC additionally ruled that petitioners' prayer for reinstatement and pa ent of back salaries and benefits are improper as the same are warrant d only when the government employee was exonerated of the admini trative charges.25 his notwithstanding, the CSC held that petitioners \"are not left without recours \" as \"[t]hey may file their claims with the proper authorit:y.\"26 Meanw ile, it directed the SRA \"to facilitate the payment and release of [their] 'RIP benefits with great dispatch.\"21 he CSC's July 3, 2019 Decision became final and executory per the Certific te ofFinality28 dated August 6, 2019.

Benja ·n S. Candari, Jr. (Atty. Candari) and Atty. Solomon A. Lobrido (Atty. Lobrid ), and officers of the GCG, was held. The GCG clarified that the suspens •o n of the implementation of the ERIP under MC No. 2017-03 was not ad cision made by the GCG, but rather a reiteration of the President's orders nder EO No. 36, series of 2017. The GCG likewise reiterated that the implem nting guidelines required under Section 3 of EO No. 203, series of 2016 w s a condition precedent before the ERIP can be implemented and the corresp nding benefits released. Considering the suspension thereof, howeve,, the GCG's authority to promulgate the implementing guidelines was likewis revoked. 39 he GCG subsequently reiterated these points in a Letter40 dated Janua 10, 2020.

Thus, they filed before t e Court the present Petition for Mandamus, which the Court received on Jan ary 5, 2021, against the SRA, represented by its Administrator and Board f Directors, the GCG, represented by its Chairman and Board of Commi sioners, and the DBM, represented by its Department Secretary, (c ollect vely, respondents) to compel the latter to release and pay their ERIP benefit pursuant to the CSC Decision. n April 26, 2021, the Court issued a Resolution45 which, among others, esolved \"to require the Office of the Solicitor General to Comment [on the Petition] (not to file a motion to dismiss) within ten (10) days from notice.\" fter several motions for extension of time to file the comment, the Office fthe Solicitor General (OSG) filed, on August 10, 2021 via registered mail, th Comment46 for respondents GCG and DBM. No comment was filed by or o behalf of the SRA. n October 11, 2021, petitioners filed a Manifestation47 informing the Court t at on October 1, 2021, EO No. 150, series of 2021 was issued approvi g the CPCS and Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles, and Job gr es for GOCCs (IOS-G) Framework and asserting that with the issuanc, thereof, \"there is no longer any impediment in the implementation of [their] RIP.\" Thus, they pray that the same be given by the Court judicial notice fi r the expeditious resolution of the petition. S bsequently, on November 16, 2021, petitioners filed their Reply48 to the OS 's Comment. Thereafter, they moved for the early resolution of the petition on the following dates: July 20, 2022;49 November 10, 2022;50 July 24,202 ;51 February 28, 2024;52 and June 25, 2024.53 44 Id. at 87-188. 45 Id. at 50-151. 46 Id. at 02-116. 47 Id. at 53-156. 48 Id. at 12-328 49 Id. at 48-352. so Id. at 57-361. 51 Id. at 70-375. 52 Id. at 78-384. 53 Id. at 86-392. hJ G.R.

The Case Before the Court titioners argue that they have a clear and unmistakable right for the release nd payment of their ERIP benefits and there is no other plain, speedy, and ade uate remedy in the ordinary course oflaw. Petitioners assert that with the pa ial implementation of the SRA's RATPLAN resulting in their separati n from the service affective August 1, 2016, they acquired a clear and u istakable right to the ERIP benefits which was offered and which they availed fpursuant to the approved RATPLAN.54 ongruently, petitioners claim that respondents unlawfully neglected the perfi rmance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. In this respect, petitioners point out that under Section 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 10154, the retirem nt benefits of retiring government employees shall be released to them w thin thirty days from their actual retirement date. While the running of the 0-day period can be tolled, the same can be justified only upon occurre ce off orce majeure or other insuperable circumstances.55 their case, petitioners claim that after receiving the funds intended ayment of their ERIP benefits from the DBM, the SRA has no other option ut to comply with its ministerial duty to release and pay the same pursuan to the IRR of RA 10154. As for the GCG, petitioners contend that the latt has no authority to advice the SRA to withhold the payment of the ERIP b nefits, notwithstanding the issuance of EO No. 36, series of 2017, because of the mandatory nature of the early release of the retirement benefits under 10154, and because EO No. 36, series of 2017, being prospective, covers nly government employees starting 2017 onwards. 56 F nally, petitioners underscore that despite their separation from the n August 1, 2016 and their numerous efforts to follow-up on the and release of the ERIP benefits, including the finality of the CSC directing the SRA to release the same, as well as their letters and appeal t the GCG and the OP which to date remain unanswered, they have yet to r ceive their ERIP benefits. Thus, they argue that they are left with no 54 Id. at 9-32. 55 Id. at 3 -35. 56 Id. Decision 11 G.R. No. 254757 recours but to file the present petition for mandamus before the Court to: (i) declare he ERIP to be valid and enforceable; (ii) declare GCG MC No. 2017- 03, whi h suspended their ERIP, as contrary to law; and (iii) \"command all respond nts to immediately pay and release their ERIP benefits with acceler ed dispatch. \"57 I their Comment,58 respondents GCG and DBM, through the OSG, primarilr argued that the Petition still suffers from fatal defects, despite the opportu ity given to petitioners to correct the same, and the filing thereof directly before the Court, violated the hierarchy of courts principle. Specifi lly, the OSG highlights the following defects in the petition: (a) the certific ion against forum shopping is not signed by all petitioners; (b) the Petition contains a false certification against forum shopping by stating that they ha e not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues a d that to the best of their knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending since as admitted, thirty-four of them filed before the Ombudsman a complai t involving the same issues; and (c) that the Petition does not specify the nam of all petitioners59 in the caption.60 Lastly, the OSG claims that the petition should have been filed before the Regional Trial Court-which has concurr nt jurisdiction over petitions for mandamus-and that the petition requires a determination of a question of fact, i.e., whether the requirements for the elease of their ERIP benefits have been complied with, which the Court c nnot resolve, it not being a trier of facts.61 n the merits, the OSG asserts that while petitioners are entitled to any benefits that may be due them under existing laws and rules, they nonetheless, failed t point out a clear legal right on their part to demand the release of their E P benefits and the corresponding ministerial duty on the part of the GCG a d the DBM to release the same that would justify the issuance of a writ of andamus. ·rstly, the OSG points out that petitioners' ERIP benefits are based on the S 's RATPLAN which was formulated and approved pursuant to EO No. 203, series of 2016. EO No. 203, series of 2016, however, required, as a precon •t ion for the computation and release of the ERIP benefits, the issuanc by the GCG of the corresponding implementing guidelines-which require ent the SRA ignored by setting the effectivity date of petitioners' early re irement on August 1, 2016 despite the GCG's reminders.63 51 Id. at 5-40. 58 Id. at 02-116. 59 Id. at 92.

Decision 12 G.R. No. 254757 orse, the OSG argues that the SRA implemented the RA TPLAN prior to the BM' s resolution of the former' s request tbr the inclusion in its 2016 Corpor te Operating Budget (COB) the needed amount for the payment of the ERIP b nefits which, lamentably, the DBM was constrained to deny for the same re son that the needed implementing guidelines for EO No. 203, series of 201 had not yet been issued. 64 Compounding the situation was the issuanc of EO No. 36, series of 2017, and the corresponding implementing guideli es under MC No. 2017-03, which suspended the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2017, including the provision on the ERIP.65 Parenth tically, the OSG argues that the subsequent issuance of EO No. 150, series f 2021 does not affect petitioners' case since the same applies prospec ively.66 S condly, the OSG counters petitioners' reliance on RA 10154 by pointin out that the mandatory release of the retirement benefits within the 30-day eriod is subject to the proviso that all the \"requirements are submitted to the c ncerned government agency at least 90 days prior to the effective date of retire\\ ent.\" In petitioners' case, this condition has not been complied with since th SRA submitted its request for supplemental budget with the DBM only on June 22, 2016 or 45 days before the effective date of petitioners' retirem nt on August 1, 2016.67 ·nally, the OSG asserts that the GCG and the DBM's respective duties with r spect to the retirement benefits of retired/retiring government employ es are discretionary, not ministerial. It argues that nowhere in RA 10149 •s it provided that the GCG has a ministerial duty to release the retirem nt benefits to GOCCs. At most, it has the duty to implement the SRA's eorganization plan, which covers petitioners' ERIP benefits. This duty, h wever, is discretionary since EO No. 203, series of 2016 specifically gave th GCG the authority to decide the requirements for and the details of the exe ution of the ERIP. Moreover, RA 10149 qualified the GCG's duty to implem nt the reorganization of GOCCs by a· contrary directive of the Preside t. In petitioners' case, the implementation of the SRA's RA TPLAN, includi g the payment of the ERIP benefits, was qualified by the contrary directiv of the President under EO No. 36, series of 2017 suspending the implem ntation of EO No. 203, series of2016.68 nent the DBM, the OSG points out that under the GCG Memorandum 2012-0 , the DBM has the duty to evaluate the annual budgetary support to GOCCs and evaluate and approve the annual COB of GOCCs, while under Rule V, Section l0(e) of the CSC Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013 i plementing RA 10154, the DBM has the duty to verify the 64 Id. at 00-201. 65 Id. at 01-202. 66 Id. at 88. 61 Id. at 02-203. 68 Id. at 03-205. 13 G.R. No. 254757 comput tion and ascertainment of whether the grant and amount of retirement benefit are in accordance with the law, among others. 69 their Reply70 to the GCG and the DBM's Comment, petitioners primari y claim the failure to include in the petition's caption of the names of some etitioners was due to mere inadvertence and at any rate, these petition rs signed the verification and certification of non-forum shopping which rms part of the body of the Petition. In this regard, petitioners invoke relaxati n of the strict application of the rules in the interest of justice and in view o the special and compelling circumstances of this case involving retired civil servants who have long been deprived of their retirement benefit .71 dditionally, petitioners argue that they did not commit forum shoppi nor was the certification they signed was falsified since the parties and cau es of action in the case filed before the Ombudsman and the present petition are different. 72 They likewise claim that their case presents special and co pelling reasons that justify direct recourse before the Court. 73 I L stly, anent the merits, petitioners maintain that they have a clear and unmista able right for the release and payment of their ERIP benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof. 74 The Issue Before the Court T e issue before the Court is whether mandamus should be issued against espondents to compel the release of petitioners' retirement benefits The Court's Ruling T e Petition is partly meritorious. I. the outset, the OSG, on behalf of GCG and DBM, prays for the outright dismissal of the Petition since (i) it was purportedly filed in violation of the h erarchy of courts and (ii)-the certification of non-forum shopping is not sig ed by all petitioners and that the same contains false certification 69 Id. 70 Id. at 312-328. 71 Id. at 314-317. 72 Id. at 3 7-318. 13 Id. at 3 7-318. 14 Id. at 3 8-325. Decision 14 G.R. No. 254757 since, a admitted, 34 of them filed before the Ombudsman a complaint involvi g the same issues. oft he hierarchy ofc ourts T e Court does not agree that the Petition should be dismissed outright for havi g been filed in violation of the hierarchy of courts principle. T e principle or doctrine of hierarchy of courts recognizes the jurisdic •o n and the various levels of courts in the country as they are establis ed under the Constitution and by law, and their relationship with one another. 5 It guides litigants as to the proper venue of appeals and/or the approp ate forum for the issuance of extraordinary writs. 76 It recognizes, too, the prac ical need to restrain parties from directly resorting to the Court when relief m y be obtained before the lower courts in order to prevent \"'inordinate demand upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters ithin its exclusive jurisdiction,' as well as to prevent the congestion of the ourt's dockets,\"77 and prevent the inevitable and resultant delay, intende or otherwise, in the adjudication of cases which often have to be remand d or referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of procedu e, or as the court better equipped to resolve factual questions.78 U der the Constitution's structure, the Supreme Court is designated as the high st court with irreducible powers, 79 whose rulings serve as precedents that oth r courts must follow because they form part of the law of the land. All oth courts are established and given their defined jurisdictions by law. As a rul , the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts and generally rules only on questio s of law;80 in contrast with the Court of Appeals and other 1s Associ tion of Medical Clinics for Overseas Workers, Inc. v.

(b) All cases involving the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, or toll, or any penalty imposed in relation thereto. (c) All cases in which the jurisdiction of any lower court is in issue.

At the lowest evel of courts are the municipal and the regional trial courts which also ha dle questions of fact and law at the first instance according to the j urisdic ion granted to them by law. 81 P rsuant to the foregoing structure and by its very essence, the hierarc y principle commands that cases must first be brought before the lowest ourt with jurisdiction, and not before the higher courts. These cases may ult mately reach the Supreme Court through the medium of an appeal or certior ri.82 Considering that jurisdiction and the leveling of the courts are defined by law, the hierarchy should leave very little opening for flexibility ( and po ential legal questions), except for the fact that the law has conferred concurr ntjurisdictions for certain cases or remedies to courts at different and defined levels. Petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and ha eas corpus, fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the regional trial courts a d the higher courts, including the Supreme Court. 83 Thus, parties are, as a ru e, required to file these petitions before the lower-ranked court; otherwi e, the petition may be dismissed outright. 84 onetheless, there are recognized exceptions to the general rule. In these si uations, the Court allows direct filing of the cases before it based on its auth rity to relax the application of its own rules. 85 Among the recognized excepti ns developed by case law' include: (a ) genuine issues of constit ionality that must be addressdd at the most immediate time;86 (b) (e) All cases in which only an error or question of law is involved.

Rather, it is the na re of the question raised by the parties in those 'exceptions' that enable us to allow the direct action before us.\"89 this case, while the issue raised is not purely legal, the Court, in its discreti n, will nonetheless allow petitioners direct recourse and resolve the Petition on its merits in the broader interest ofj ustice, as will be discussed. oreover, the Court is compelled to address the issue raised in view of the exig ncy of the situation wherein petitioners appear to have been left with no othe plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. N otabl , there is no dispute that petitioners retired/separated from the SRA on August , 2016 pursuant to the ERIP that it offered to facilitate its RAT PLAN which t e GCG approved. Despite their retirement/separation on August 1, 2016, p titioners have not received any retirement benefits from the SRA to date- hich fact likewise remains undisputed. From the time they retired from th SRA, petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies before the SRA, th GCG and even before the OP, among others, to secure the release of their retirement benefits-all of which proved futile.

Meeting with the GCG officers, following the November 20, 2019 Letter, to discuss petitioners' claim for their retirement benefits. Letter dated January 23, 2020 to the OP requesting that the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM be ordered to \"immediately release and pay the SRA retirees and/or separatees their ERIP benefits,\" which the GCG supported by recommending that an ERIP, similar to the one provided under EO No. 203, series of 2016, be granted to qualified SRA employees. date, petitioners have not received their retirement benefits despite having een retired/separated fromthe SRA for over eight years. Neither have there b en any significant action taken on the part of respondents and/or relevant other government agencies to address petitioners' concerns. In the interim, some of the petitioners have already died.90 Verily, the broader interest f justice and the exigency of the situation calls for and justifies the deviatio from the principle that demands observance of the hierarchy of courts p •n ciple. False c rtification of non-forum shopping and mi sing signatures therein of certain petition rs ither can the Court subscribe to the GCG and the DBM's plea to he Petition for failure of some petitioners to sign the certification of non-fo m shopping and for certifying that petitioners have not commenced any oth r action or proceeding involving the same issues and that to the best of their knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending even when 90 These re: Collin Vinas and Eufemia V. Linco, who died on July 31, 2017 and March 26, 2018, respec ·vely. See Extra Judicial Declaration of Heirship and Settlement of Estate executed by their respec ·ve heirs; rollo, pp. 140-141 & 142-144, respectively. See also petitioners' Motion for Early Resolu ion filed on July 20, 2022, which stated that six of the petitioners have already died; it did not, howev r, specify the names of these six petitioners, see id. at 349. ~ Decisio ; 18 G.R. No. 254757 sever~l of them have filed a complaint before the Ombudsman involving the same 1s ues. ule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, as further amended, states that \"the pl intiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other i itiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certific tion annexed thereto and simultaneous~y filed therewith: a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same is ues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his kno ledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status t ereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action r claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) alendar days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initi tory pleading has been filed.\" The failure of the plaintiff or principal party to comply therewith \"shall not be curable by mere amendment of the compla\"nt or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice.\" Thus, as a rule, all the plaintiff or principal parties to a cas must sign the certification of non-forum shopping, failing in which will wa ant the dismissal of the case. owever, in Altres v. Empleo,91 the Court held that the failure of the otherp itioners to sign the certification of non-forum shopping for justifiable reasons should not result in the outright dismissal of the case. Verily, the signing of the certification by more than a majority of the petitioners, as in this cas , \"already sufficiently assures the Court that the allegations in the pleadin are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of spec lation; that the pleading is filed in good faith; and that the signatories are unq estionably real parties-in-interest who undoubtedly have sufficient knowle ge and belief to swear to the truth of the allegations in the petition.\"92 To prov de guidance for the bench, the bar, and the public, the Court inAltres further summarized the guidelines found in case law respecting non compli ce with the requirements on, or submission of defective, verification and cert fication of non-forum shopping, viz.: For the guidance of the bench and bar, the Court restates in capsule the jurisprudential pronouncements already reflected above respecting n n-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of defective, v rification and certification against forum shopping: I) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the r uirement on or submission ofd efective verification, and non-compliance w th the requirement on or submission of defective certification against ~ m shopping. 91 594 P ·1. 246 (2008) [Per J. Carpio Morales, En Banc]. 92 Id. at 0. Decision 19 G.R. No. 254757 2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein d es not necessarily render the· pleading fatally defective. The court may o der its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending c cumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be d spensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby. 3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one o has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the c mplaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the p tition have been made in good faith or are true and correct. 4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance t erewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not c rable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the round of \"substantial com liance\" resence of \"s ecial circumstances or com ellin reasons.\" 5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by a the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not si n will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or • stifiable circumstances however as when all the laintiffs or titioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of a tion or defense the si nature of onl one of them in the certification a ainst forum sho in substantiall com lies with the Rule. 6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be e ecuted by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for re sonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must e ecute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to on his behalf. 93 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) re, petitioners undoubtedly share a common interest and invoke a comma cause of action, i.e., the release of their long-awaited ERIP benefits which t ey availed of pursuant to the SRA's RATPLAN which they have yet to recei e despite their separation from the service since 2016. Under these circums ances, petitioners' substantial compliance with the requirements of the rule and the presence of special and compelling reasons should not merit the out •g ht dismissal of their petition without defeating the administration of justice. F nally, the alleged false certification must be brushed aside for lack of merit. petitioners aptly argued, the parties and causes of action in the case filed be re the Ombudsman and the present Petition are different. Indeed, the complai t before the Ombudsman was filed against the administrator94 of the SRA an , while praying for the release of their ERIP benefits, essentially sought t hold the latter liable for non-compliance with the CSC's Decision and for iolation of RA 10154 and Section 5(a) of RA 6713. In contrast, the present etition filed against the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM ultimately 93 Id. at 2 1-262; citations omitted. 94 Specifi ally named as respondent was SRA Administrator Hermenigildo R. Serafica; rollo, p. 63. 20 G.R. No. 254757 Decisiol seeks t compel these government agencies to release their ERIP benefits which t ey purportedly have negligently failed to do so. 11 told, petitioners' substantial compliance and the surrounding circum tances of the case justify the relaxation of the procedural rules in the broader interest ofj ustice. II. P oceeding to the merits oft he petition, petitioners argue that they have a clear nd unmistakable right for the release and payment of their retirement benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof and wh~ch respondents unlawfully neglected to perform. The GCG and the DBM, n the other hand, assert that petitioners failed to point out a clear legal right o their part to demand the release of these benefits and the corresp nding ministerial duty on the part oft he GCG and the DBM to release the sam . nd concept ofm andamus andamus is a command issuing from a court of law of competent jurisdic •o n, in the name of the state or sovereign, directed to some in erior court, tribunal, or board, or to some corporation or person, equiring the performance of a particular duty therein specified, which duty res Its from the official station of the party to whom the writ is directed, or from peration of law. It is an extraordinary remedy issued only in cases of extreme necessity where the ordinary course of procedure is powerless to afford adequate and speedy relief to one who has a clear legal right to the perform nee of the act to be compelled.95 Moreover, its principal function is to com and and to expedite, not to inquire and to adjudicate96 U1 der our Rules, the remedy of mandamus is governed by Rule 65, Section of the Rules of Court, viz.: Section 3. Petition for mandamus. - When any tribunal, oration, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance o an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an o ce, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and e •o yment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no ot er plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the p son aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, al eging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered c mantling the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be 95 Specia People, Inc.

No. 254757 s ecified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights o the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by r on of the wrongful acts of the respondent. B cause of its nature as an extraordinary remedy, mandamus will lie only if t e following requisites are present: first, the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the act demanded, or those rights which are founded in law, are specific certain, clear, established, complete, undisputed or unquestioned, and are ithout any semblance or color of doubt;97 second, it must be the duty of the d fendant to perform the act, because it is mandated by law; third, the defenda t unlawfully neglects the performance of the duty enjoined by law; fourth, t e act to be performed is ministerial, not discretionary; and, fifth there is no ap eal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course f law.98 C se law provides that a purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer r tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obed ence to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. 99 t connotes an act in which nothing is left to the discretion of the person xecuting it. It is a simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitte or proved to exist and imposed by law.100 If the law imposes a duty upon a ublic officer and gives them the right to decide how or when the duty shall be erformed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministe al only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of offic· al discretion or judgment.101 This notwithstanding, case law settles that ma damus is available to compel action, when refused, on matters involvin discretion, but not to direct the exercise ofj udgment or discretion one way or the other.102 Relevan facts and circumstances governing petition rs ' claim A plying the foregoing concepts and considering the extraordinary nature f the remedy of mandamus, it is pertinent first to highlight several undispu ed facts that are crucial to the resolution of petitioners' claim: (i) the GCG approved the SRA's RATPLAN; 97 Naza~ o v. City ofD umaguete, 601 Phil. 768,800 (2009) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, En Banc). 98 Provin e of Maguindanao de/ Norte v. Bureau of Local Government Finance, G.R. No. 265373, Nove ber 13, 2023 [Per J.

No. 254757 (ii) the GCG required the SRA to (a) adopt and offer the r tirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the i plementation of the reorganization strengthening, and (b) implement t e new structure and staffing \"within two (2) months after receipt of [ he GCG's approval of the RATPLAN]\"; (iii) petitioners have been retired/separated from their e ployment with the SRA on August 1, 2016 upon availing of the early r tirement incentive program that it (the SRA) offered pursuant to its TPLAN; (iv) petitioners were qualified and complied with the r quirements for availing of the ERIP and had no participation in the i plementation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the ERIP other than a plying for the latter; and (v) petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies to s cure the release of their retirement benefits, all of which proved futile. T ese crucial facts must never be lost in the Court's consideration of petition rs' plea as the sole issue in the Court's resolution of the Petition is whethe petitioners are entitled to the issuance of mandamus to command and expedit the release of their retirement benefits. F r these reasons and by the very nature of the remedy of mandamus, the pro riety of the actions taken in the implementation of the RATPLAN and the ERI will not be the subject of the Court's present disquisition. Verily, any pe ceived error that may have been committed or omitted in the implem ntation of the ERIP should be addressed by the relevant authorities in the roper forum. Regardless, the same has and should not bear any relevan e to petitioners' present plea before the Court for the release of their long ov rdue retirement benefits which the interest of justice and fair play compel the Court to finally and fully resolve. The gra t ofE RIP benefits to petitioners 10154 ensures the \"timely and expeditious release of the retirement pay ... and other benefits of retiring government employees.\" Having spent the bes years of their lives serving the government, these government employ es are assured by the State that they will not be made to wait to receive the benefits due to them under the law. Accordingly, RA 10154 mandat s that \"high priority shall be given to the payment and/or settlement of the ... retirement benefits of retiring government employees.\"103 The '° 3 See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. I. 23 G.R. No. 254757 govern ent employees covered by RA 10154 includes those serving in all branch s of the government, including GOCCs such as the SRA.104 nder Section 2 of the same law, the head of the government agency conce ed is mandated to ensure the release of the retirement pay and other benefit of a retiring government employee within a period of 30 days from the dat of the actual retirement of said employee. The immediate release of the reti ment pay is, however, subject to the condition that \"all requirements are sub itted to the concerned government agency within at least 90 days prior to he effective date of retirement.\" The unjustified failure and/or refusal to rele se the retirement benefits due to a retiring government employee within hese periods shall result in administrative liability, unless the non release of the retirement benefits is due to ''force majeure and other ble causes.\"105 ese prov1s1ons are reiterated in Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013, as amended by Resolution No. 1302242, dated October 1, 2013, hich the CSC issued to implement the provisions of RA 10154, pursuan to Section 6 thereof. In addition, the CSC Resolutions implementing RA 10 54 (IRR), details the responsibilities of the employer-agency, the retiring employees, and the DBM, with respect to the pro~essing of the retirem nt pay of the retiring employee, including the relevant periods governi g the same, as well as the requirements for availing thereof, viz.:106 RULE IV R SPONSIBILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER-AGENCY AND RETIRING EMPLOYEES Section 8. Responsibilities of Employer-Agency. The government a ency where the employee will retire shall: a. Send the retiring employee a letter not later than one (1) year prior to the effectivity of his/her retirement, informing him/her to submit his/her expression of intent to retire as provided under Section 9 hereof, and notifying him/her to submit the necessary requirements at least one hundred (100) days prior to the effectivity date of his/her retirement. Moreover, the employer-agency shall compute the retiree's total number of accumulated years of government service. Should the same be less than fifteen (15) years at the retiree's expected date of retirement, the retiree shall be informed that he/she may request directly before the CSC for the extension of his/her service. For this purpose, the extension of service shall in no case 104 See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. 4. ios See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. 5. 106 See Re olution No. 1300237, Sec. 8 to Sec. IO.

Upon submission of an employee's written intent to retire, provide the retiring employee with the retirement application form, with the accompanying checklist of all the requirements for retirement purposes; c. Upon submission of the requirements, the date of such submission shall be stamp marked on the corresponding item in the retirement application form in clear bold marked, countersigned by the proper receiving and validating employee; d. Process the application for retirement, compute the appropriate retirement benefits, and verify the authenticity, accuracy, and consistency of the data contained in the documents submitted; e. Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the actual date of retirement, endorse to GSIS, [DBM] and other concerned agencies the request of the retiring employee together with the complete set of documentary requirements; f. Submit, as part of its budget proposal to the DBM, a list of its officials and employees who shall compulsorily retire in the next succeeding fiscal year for the latter's incorporation in the Pension and Gratuity Fund; h. Upon receipt of the required funds form the DBM, record and release such funds to the retiring employee within the period prescribed under Section 5. Section 9. Responsibilities of Retiring Employee. The retiring e ployee shall: a. Submit a written expression of intent to retire indicating the desired date of retirement and the retirement package he/she intends to avail at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to his/her actual retirement date; and b. Submit the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the employer-agency not later than one hundred (100) days prior to the actual/intended date of retirement. RULEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE [DBM] Section I 0. Responsibilities of the [DBM]. For terminal leave b nefits and retirement gratuity under . . . Republic Act No. 1616, as a ended, and other relevant laws, the DBM shall perform the following: c. Within one (I) day from receipt of documents, ascertain whether all documents in the prescribed standard list have been Decision 25 G.R. No. 254757 submitted, and if incomplete, immediately call the attention of the employer-agency; d. Within ten ( I 0) days from submission of all documentary requirements, verify the computation, ascertain whether the grant and amount of retirement benefits are in accordance with law, and release the required funds to the employer-agency; Provided, that an additional ten (10) days shall be required if initial findings indicate that a more comprehensive legal due diligence is needed. (Emphasis supplied) S gnificantly, under these provisions, the sole responsibility of the retiring ovemment employee with respect to the release of their retirement benefits is to submit, within the prescribed periods, their written expression of inten to retire and the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the e ployer-agency. Upon their performance thereof, the retiring ent employees have nothing more to do than wait for their retirement thereafter the release of their retirement benefits which should not be 30 days from the actual date of their retirement. Meanwhile, the responsibility for processing and ensuring the timely release f the retirement benefits is primarily lodged with the employer agency d the DBM who, by their nature, holds the relevant power and authorit over the necessary documents and funds for the payment thereof. that the necessary documents and prerequisite steps have been complie with, the tasks to be performed by them, within specified timelines or perio s, in processing the retirement application and retirement benefits are mandat ry leaving no room for discretion. For this reason, the administrative sanctio for the unjustified non-payment of the retirement benefits is imposed only on the officials and/or employees of these agencies who holds the respons • ility of ensuring the timely release of the same. I this case, it is well to recall that in 2015, the SRA formulated the RAT PL to strengthen its organizational structure and capacity to enable it to fulfil the objectives of RA 10659. On April 12, 2016, the GCG approved the S 's RATPLAN under MO No. 2016-05. In the implementation of the RATPL N, the GCG set as conditions, that: (i) the SRA shall \"adopt and offer th retirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the imp mentation oft he organizational strengthening using the incentives provide under EO No. 203;\" and (ii) the new organizational structure and staffing hall be implemented within 2 months after receipt ofM O No. 2016- 05. The incentives referred to in MO No. 2016-05 are found in Section 7 of EO No. 03, series of 2016, viz.: SEC. 7. Early Retirement Incentive Plan (ERIP). - All Officers Employees covered by the CPCS who voluntarily elect to be retired or Decisio 26 G.R. No. 254757 •a y be separated from the service, as part of the performance by GCG of i mandate under Section 5(a) of R.A. No. I 0149 to rationalize, reorganize, erge, or restructure a GOCC, shall be granted the following early r tirement incentive in addition to retirement or separation benefits under e isting laws: Government Service Rates , First 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 20 years and 1 day to 30 years I .25 x BMP x No. of years 30 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years *Basic Monthly Pay (BMP) P rsuant to the foregoing conditions fixed by MO No. 2016-05, the SRA is ued Memorandum IAD-2016-May-003 informing all its employees of the proval of its RA TPLAN and further inviting those who wanted to avail o the ERIP. The SRA likewise set August 1, 2016 as the effective date of sepa ation from the service of those who availed of the ERIP, which include petitioners, to coincide with the two-month period set for the implem ntation of the SRA's new organization structure and staffing, followi g the condition set in MO No. 2016-05. espite their separation from the service on August 1, 2016, however, petition[rs' retirement benefits were not released due to the absence of the require guidelines for the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2016, as require under Section 3 thereof. In the interim, EO No. 36. series of 2017 was iss ed suspending the implementation ofEO No. 203, series of 2016, and concom tantly the issuance of the required guidelines, further delaying the release f petitioners' retirement benefits. T be sure, the Court recognizes that the early retirement package offered o petitioners used the incentives provided under EO No. 203, series of 201 , pursuant to MO No. 2016-05, and for this reason, gives the impress on that the retirement benefits due to petitioners were granted by EO No. 203 series of2016 which, having been suspended and thereafter repealed, have ah~ ady effectively forfeited petitioners' retirement benefits. T is impression aside, the Court is of the view that it was actually the RATPL N, which the GCG approved pursuant to the powers granted to it under S ction 5(a) of RA 10149-and not EO No. 203, series of2016-which formed he basis for the implementation of the early retirement package offered o petitioners. To emphasize, MO No. 2016-05, which approved the SRA's TPLAN, required the adoption and offering of retirement and separati n package for the affected personnel in recognition of the reality that the rear anization of the SRA would necessarily entail declaring certain position as redundant and concomitantly, the voluntary/involuntary separati n/retirement of certain employees from the service. Thus, to the Court's ind, the reference to EO No. 203, series of 2016 with respect to the Decision 27 G.R. No. 254757 retirem nt package to be offered to the affected SRA employees was made pursu t to State policy of standardizing the compensation of government official and employees, including those in the GOCCs. In other words, EO No. 20 , series of 2016 was referenced to serve merely as basis for the determi ation and computation of the amount of the retirement benefits due to eac retiring employee of the SRA. Accordingly, petitioners having comp Ii d with the requirements of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the r tirement and separation package offered in the implementation of the RA TP N, they have become entitled by law and equity to the corresponding retirem nt benefits. this regard, it should be borne in mind that the authority to determine a GOCC should be reorganized and-upon \"its determination that it best interest of the State that a GOCC should be reorganized\"-to the corresponding reorganization plan and early retirement incentive progr is lodged with the GCG pursuant to Section S(a) of RA 10149. Having pproved the SRA's RATPLAN, the same signified as an imprimatur by the tate, through the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid a lawful. Consequently, the absence of the implementing guidelines of EO o. 203, series of 2016, as well as the subsequent suspension thereof by EO o. 36, series of 2017, are not sufficient bases to deny petitioners their retirem nt benefits. tably, on October 11, 2021, EO No. 150, series of 2021 was issued approvi g and providing for the new CPCS and Index of Occupational Service, Position Titles, and Job Grades for GOCCs (IOS-G) Framework, thereby epealing EO No. 203, series of 2016. Subsequently, on January 12, 2022, t e GCG issued Guidelines No. 2021-001 to implement EO No. 150, series o 2021. Relevantly, Section 13 of EO No. 150, series of 2021, like Section 7 of EO No. 203, series of 2021, similarly authorizes the GCG, pursuan to Section 5(a) of RA 10149, \"to grant an [ERIP] to officers and employ es who voluntarily elect to be retired\" in accordance with the rates provide under Section 12, viz.: Government Service Rates irst 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 0 years and 1 day to 30 years 1.25 x BMP x No. of years 0 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years * asic Monthly Pay (BMP) oreover, the rates provided under Section 12 of EO No. 150, series of 2021 ar largely similar to those provided under Section 7 of EO No. 203, series o 2016. What evidently differs is the basic monthly pay from which shall be omputed the total amount of the retirement benefits which a retiring employ e shall receive. 28 G.R. No. 254757 his notwithstanding, and while there appears to be no explicit statem nt under EO No. 150, series of 2021 providing for its retroactive applica ion, the Court finds no justifiable and equitable reason not to consider the iss ance of EO No. 150, series of 2021 and its implementing guidelines as the emoval or cessation of the \"insuperable cause\" that prevented the release fpetitioners' retirement benefits to which they had long been entitled pursu t to the implementation of the RATPLAN. To rule otherwise would only le ve petitioners' claim indefinitely unresolved. Verily, the dictates of justice d equity call for an equitable resolution to petitioners' situation who has so ar not found relief in the various measures taken by them. quity, as the complement of legal jurisdiction, seeks to reach and do comp le e justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their rules and wa t of power to adapt their judgments to the special circumstances of cases, e incompetent to do so. \"Equity regards the spirit and not the letter, the inte t and not the form, the substance rather than the circumstance, as it is various y expressed by different courts.\"107 In the exercise of its equity jurisdic ion, the Court may adjust the rights of parties in accordance with the circum tances obtaining at the time of rendition of judgment, when these are signific ntly different from those existing at the time of generation of those rights.1 8 ccordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the Court, in the exercis of its equity jurisdiction, rules that petitioners are entitled to the payme of their retirement benefits which respondents the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM must determine, process, and facilitate with due dispatch. It must b emphasized herein that the Court, in making this declaration, is not directin the exercise of respondents' discretion one way or the other. Rather, the Cou is directing respondents to perform their respective mandated duties under 10154 and other relevant laws and rules. Evidently, matters relating to the s urce of the budget for the payment of petitioners' retirement benefits, the co utation thereof, the procedure for the release of the same, and other relevan details is subject to the respondents' discretion in the exercise of their respecti e powers and mandates. summary, the GCG's approval of the SRA's RATPLAN, in the of its discretion under RA 10149, signified as an imprimatur by the State, t ough the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid and law I. The early retirement package offered to petitioners and which they availed of was adopted pursuant to this approved RATPLAN.

No. 254757 petitio ers have become entitled by law and equity to the corresponding retirem nt benefits and to the timely release thereof pursuant to RA 10154. Morea er, under RA 10154, the responsibility for processing, within specified periods or timelines and prerequisite steps, and ensuring the timely release of the peti ioners' retirement benefits are primarily lodged with the SRA and the DBM. Final final word. The Court's present disposition must be considered in the light of he surrounding circumstances of this case that has left petitioners with neither heir employment with the SRA nor the retirement benefits to which they ar entitled. As it is, petitioners' separation from the service is a fait accom i that can no longer be rectified by a misdirected emphasis and an obstina e insistence on the invalidity of the actions taken in the implem ntation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the corresponding early retirem nt package. Regardless of the various reasons that prevented the timely ffl ease of the retirement benefits, it is undisputed that petitioners have served t e government and have subsequently voluntarily retired therefrom to pave t e way for the SRA's reorganization. Clearly, no reasonable and justifia le objection can be made to further deny petitioners their retirement benefits which they are clearly entitled under the law.

Since the RATPLAN was formulated pursuant to EO No. 203, series o 2016 and RA 10149, and petitioners' separation/retirement from the SRA w s made pursuant thereto, their separation from the service cannot be conside ed illegal under the Constitution. Consequently, the non payme t/non-receipt of the retirement/separation pay and other benefits will not ren er illegal the otherwise legal cause of their separation. 24 In view thereof, the CSC additionally ruled that petitioners' prayer for reinstatement and pa ent of back salaries and benefits are improper as the same are warrant d only when the government employee was exonerated of the admini trative charges.25 his notwithstanding, the CSC held that petitioners \"are not left without recours \" as \"[t]hey may file their claims with the proper authorit:y.\"26 Meanw ile, it directed the SRA \"to facilitate the payment and release of [their] 'RIP benefits with great dispatch.\"21 he CSC's July 3, 2019 Decision became final and executory per the Certific te ofFinality28 dated August 6, 2019.

The Case Before the Court titioners argue that they have a clear and unmistakable right for the release nd payment of their ERIP benefits and there is no other plain, speedy, and ade uate remedy in the ordinary course oflaw. Petitioners assert that with the pa ial implementation of the SRA's RATPLAN resulting in their separati n from the service affective August 1, 2016, they acquired a clear and u istakable right to the ERIP benefits which was offered and which they availed fpursuant to the approved RATPLAN.54 ongruently, petitioners claim that respondents unlawfully neglected the perfi rmance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. In this respect, petitioners point out that under Section 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 10154, the retirem nt benefits of retiring government employees shall be released to them w thin thirty days from their actual retirement date. While the running of the 0-day period can be tolled, the same can be justified only upon occurre ce off orce majeure or other insuperable circumstances.55 their case, petitioners claim that after receiving the funds intended ayment of their ERIP benefits from the DBM, the SRA has no other option ut to comply with its ministerial duty to release and pay the same pursuan to the IRR of RA 10154. As for the GCG, petitioners contend that the latt has no authority to advice the SRA to withhold the payment of the ERIP b nefits, notwithstanding the issuance of EO No. 36, series of 2017, because of the mandatory nature of the early release of the retirement benefits under 10154, and because EO No. 36, series of 2017, being prospective, covers nly government employees starting 2017 onwards. 56 F nally, petitioners underscore that despite their separation from the n August 1, 2016 and their numerous efforts to follow-up on the and release of the ERIP benefits, including the finality of the CSC directing the SRA to release the same, as well as their letters and appeal t the GCG and the OP which to date remain unanswered, they have yet to r ceive their ERIP benefits. Thus, they argue that they are left with no 54 Id. at 9-32. 55 Id. at 3 -35. 56 Id. Decision 11 G.R. No. 254757 recours but to file the present petition for mandamus before the Court to: (i) declare he ERIP to be valid and enforceable; (ii) declare GCG MC No. 2017- 03, whi h suspended their ERIP, as contrary to law; and (iii) \"command all respond nts to immediately pay and release their ERIP benefits with acceler ed dispatch. \"57 I their Comment,58 respondents GCG and DBM, through the OSG, primarilr argued that the Petition still suffers from fatal defects, despite the opportu ity given to petitioners to correct the same, and the filing thereof directly before the Court, violated the hierarchy of courts principle. Specifi lly, the OSG highlights the following defects in the petition: (a) the certific ion against forum shopping is not signed by all petitioners; (b) the Petition contains a false certification against forum shopping by stating that they ha e not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues a d that to the best of their knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending since as admitted, thirty-four of them filed before the Ombudsman a complai t involving the same issues; and (c) that the Petition does not specify the nam of all petitioners59 in the caption.60 Lastly, the OSG claims that the petition should have been filed before the Regional Trial Court-which has concurr nt jurisdiction over petitions for mandamus-and that the petition requires a determination of a question of fact, i.e., whether the requirements for the elease of their ERIP benefits have been complied with, which the Court c nnot resolve, it not being a trier of facts.61 n the merits, the OSG asserts that while petitioners are entitled to any benefits that may be due them under existing laws and rules, they nonetheless, failed t point out a clear legal right on their part to demand the release of their E P benefits and the corresponding ministerial duty on the part of the GCG a d the DBM to release the same that would justify the issuance of a writ of andamus. ·rstly, the OSG points out that petitioners' ERIP benefits are based on the S 's RATPLAN which was formulated and approved pursuant to EO No. 203, series of 2016. EO No. 203, series of 2016, however, required, as a precon •t ion for the computation and release of the ERIP benefits, the issuanc by the GCG of the corresponding implementing guidelines-which require ent the SRA ignored by setting the effectivity date of petitioners' early re irement on August 1, 2016 despite the GCG's reminders.63 51 Id. at 5-40. 58 Id. at 02-116. 59 Id. at 92.

Decision 12 G.R. No. 254757 orse, the OSG argues that the SRA implemented the RA TPLAN prior to the BM' s resolution of the former' s request tbr the inclusion in its 2016 Corpor te Operating Budget (COB) the needed amount for the payment of the ERIP b nefits which, lamentably, the DBM was constrained to deny for the same re son that the needed implementing guidelines for EO No. 203, series of 201 had not yet been issued. 64 Compounding the situation was the issuanc of EO No. 36, series of 2017, and the corresponding implementing guideli es under MC No. 2017-03, which suspended the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2017, including the provision on the ERIP.65 Parenth tically, the OSG argues that the subsequent issuance of EO No. 150, series f 2021 does not affect petitioners' case since the same applies prospec ively.66 S condly, the OSG counters petitioners' reliance on RA 10154 by pointin out that the mandatory release of the retirement benefits within the 30-day eriod is subject to the proviso that all the \"requirements are submitted to the c ncerned government agency at least 90 days prior to the effective date of retire\\ ent.\" In petitioners' case, this condition has not been complied with since th SRA submitted its request for supplemental budget with the DBM only on June 22, 2016 or 45 days before the effective date of petitioners' retirem nt on August 1, 2016.67 ·nally, the OSG asserts that the GCG and the DBM's respective duties with r spect to the retirement benefits of retired/retiring government employ es are discretionary, not ministerial. It argues that nowhere in RA 10149 •s it provided that the GCG has a ministerial duty to release the retirem nt benefits to GOCCs. At most, it has the duty to implement the SRA's eorganization plan, which covers petitioners' ERIP benefits. This duty, h wever, is discretionary since EO No. 203, series of 2016 specifically gave th GCG the authority to decide the requirements for and the details of the exe ution of the ERIP. Moreover, RA 10149 qualified the GCG's duty to implem nt the reorganization of GOCCs by a· contrary directive of the Preside t. In petitioners' case, the implementation of the SRA's RA TPLAN, includi g the payment of the ERIP benefits, was qualified by the contrary directiv of the President under EO No. 36, series of 2017 suspending the implem ntation of EO No. 203, series of2016.68 nent the DBM, the OSG points out that under the GCG Memorandum 2012-0 , the DBM has the duty to evaluate the annual budgetary support to GOCCs and evaluate and approve the annual COB of GOCCs, while under Rule V, Section l0(e) of the CSC Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013 i plementing RA 10154, the DBM has the duty to verify the 64 Id. at 00-201. 65 Id. at 01-202. 66 Id. at 88. 61 Id. at 02-203. 68 Id. at 03-205. 13 G.R. No. 254757 comput tion and ascertainment of whether the grant and amount of retirement benefit are in accordance with the law, among others. 69 their Reply70 to the GCG and the DBM's Comment, petitioners primari y claim the failure to include in the petition's caption of the names of some etitioners was due to mere inadvertence and at any rate, these petition rs signed the verification and certification of non-forum shopping which rms part of the body of the Petition. In this regard, petitioners invoke relaxati n of the strict application of the rules in the interest of justice and in view o the special and compelling circumstances of this case involving retired civil servants who have long been deprived of their retirement benefit .71 dditionally, petitioners argue that they did not commit forum shoppi nor was the certification they signed was falsified since the parties and cau es of action in the case filed before the Ombudsman and the present petition are different. 72 They likewise claim that their case presents special and co pelling reasons that justify direct recourse before the Court. 73 I L stly, anent the merits, petitioners maintain that they have a clear and unmista able right for the release and payment of their ERIP benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof. 74 The Issue Before the Court T e issue before the Court is whether mandamus should be issued against espondents to compel the release of petitioners' retirement benefits The Court's Ruling T e Petition is partly meritorious. I. the outset, the OSG, on behalf of GCG and DBM, prays for the outright dismissal of the Petition since (i) it was purportedly filed in violation of the h erarchy of courts and (ii)-the certification of non-forum shopping is not sig ed by all petitioners and that the same contains false certification 69 Id. 70 Id. at 312-328. 71 Id. at 314-317. 72 Id. at 3 7-318. 13 Id. at 3 7-318. 14 Id. at 3 8-325.

T e principle or doctrine of hierarchy of courts recognizes the jurisdic •o n and the various levels of courts in the country as they are establis ed under the Constitution and by law, and their relationship with one another. 5 It guides litigants as to the proper venue of appeals and/or the approp ate forum for the issuance of extraordinary writs. 76 It recognizes, too, the prac ical need to restrain parties from directly resorting to the Court when relief m y be obtained before the lower courts in order to prevent \"'inordinate demand upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters ithin its exclusive jurisdiction,' as well as to prevent the congestion of the ourt's dockets,\"77 and prevent the inevitable and resultant delay, intende or otherwise, in the adjudication of cases which often have to be remand d or referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of procedu e, or as the court better equipped to resolve factual questions.78 U der the Constitution's structure, the Supreme Court is designated as the high st court with irreducible powers, 79 whose rulings serve as precedents that oth r courts must follow because they form part of the law of the land. All oth courts are established and given their defined jurisdictions by law. As a rul , the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts and generally rules only on questio s of law;80 in contrast with the Court of Appeals and other 1s Associ tion of Medical Clinics for Overseas Workers, Inc. v.

At the lowest evel of courts are the municipal and the regional trial courts which also ha dle questions of fact and law at the first instance according to the j urisdic ion granted to them by law. 81 P rsuant to the foregoing structure and by its very essence, the hierarc y principle commands that cases must first be brought before the lowest ourt with jurisdiction, and not before the higher courts. These cases may ult mately reach the Supreme Court through the medium of an appeal or certior ri.82 Considering that jurisdiction and the leveling of the courts are defined by law, the hierarchy should leave very little opening for flexibility ( and po ential legal questions), except for the fact that the law has conferred concurr ntjurisdictions for certain cases or remedies to courts at different and defined levels. Petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and ha eas corpus, fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the regional trial courts a d the higher courts, including the Supreme Court. 83 Thus, parties are, as a ru e, required to file these petitions before the lower-ranked court; otherwi e, the petition may be dismissed outright. 84 onetheless, there are recognized exceptions to the general rule. In these si uations, the Court allows direct filing of the cases before it based on its auth rity to relax the application of its own rules. 85 Among the recognized excepti ns developed by case law' include: (a ) genuine issues of constit ionality that must be addressdd at the most immediate time;86 (b) (e) All cases in which only an error or question of law is involved.

Rather, it is the na re of the question raised by the parties in those 'exceptions' that enable us to allow the direct action before us.\"89 this case, while the issue raised is not purely legal, the Court, in its discreti n, will nonetheless allow petitioners direct recourse and resolve the Petition on its merits in the broader interest ofj ustice, as will be discussed. oreover, the Court is compelled to address the issue raised in view of the exig ncy of the situation wherein petitioners appear to have been left with no othe plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. N otabl , there is no dispute that petitioners retired/separated from the SRA on August , 2016 pursuant to the ERIP that it offered to facilitate its RAT PLAN which t e GCG approved. Despite their retirement/separation on August 1, 2016, p titioners have not received any retirement benefits from the SRA to date- hich fact likewise remains undisputed. From the time they retired from th SRA, petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies before the SRA, th GCG and even before the OP, among others, to secure the release of their retirement benefits-all of which proved futile.

No. 254757 sever~l of them have filed a complaint before the Ombudsman involving the same 1s ues. ule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, as further amended, states that \"the pl intiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other i itiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certific tion annexed thereto and simultaneous~y filed therewith: a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same is ues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his kno ledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status t ereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action r claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) alendar days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initi tory pleading has been filed.\" The failure of the plaintiff or principal party to comply therewith \"shall not be curable by mere amendment of the compla\"nt or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice.\" Thus, as a rule, all the plaintiff or principal parties to a cas must sign the certification of non-forum shopping, failing in which will wa ant the dismissal of the case. owever, in Altres v. Empleo,91 the Court held that the failure of the otherp itioners to sign the certification of non-forum shopping for justifiable reasons should not result in the outright dismissal of the case. Verily, the signing of the certification by more than a majority of the petitioners, as in this cas , \"already sufficiently assures the Court that the allegations in the pleadin are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of spec lation; that the pleading is filed in good faith; and that the signatories are unq estionably real parties-in-interest who undoubtedly have sufficient knowle ge and belief to swear to the truth of the allegations in the petition.\"92 To prov de guidance for the bench, the bar, and the public, the Court inAltres further summarized the guidelines found in case law respecting non compli ce with the requirements on, or submission of defective, verification and cert fication of non-forum shopping, viz.: For the guidance of the bench and bar, the Court restates in capsule the jurisprudential pronouncements already reflected above respecting n n-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of defective, v rification and certification against forum shopping: I) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the r uirement on or submission ofd efective verification, and non-compliance w th the requirement on or submission of defective certification against ~ m shopping. 91 594 P ·1. 246 (2008) [Per J. Carpio Morales, En Banc]. 92 Id. at 0. Decision 19 G.R. No. 254757 2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein d es not necessarily render the· pleading fatally defective. The court may o der its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending c cumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be d spensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby. 3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one o has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the c mplaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the p tition have been made in good faith or are true and correct. 4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance t erewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not c rable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the round of \"substantial com liance\" resence of \"s ecial circumstances or com ellin reasons.\" 5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by a the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not si n will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or • stifiable circumstances however as when all the laintiffs or titioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of a tion or defense the si nature of onl one of them in the certification a ainst forum sho in substantiall com lies with the Rule. 6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be e ecuted by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for re sonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must e ecute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to on his behalf. 93 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) re, petitioners undoubtedly share a common interest and invoke a comma cause of action, i.e., the release of their long-awaited ERIP benefits which t ey availed of pursuant to the SRA's RATPLAN which they have yet to recei e despite their separation from the service since 2016. Under these circums ances, petitioners' substantial compliance with the requirements of the rule and the presence of special and compelling reasons should not merit the out •g ht dismissal of their petition without defeating the administration of justice. F nally, the alleged false certification must be brushed aside for lack of merit. petitioners aptly argued, the parties and causes of action in the case filed be re the Ombudsman and the present Petition are different. Indeed, the complai t before the Ombudsman was filed against the administrator94 of the SRA an , while praying for the release of their ERIP benefits, essentially sought t hold the latter liable for non-compliance with the CSC's Decision and for iolation of RA 10154 and Section 5(a) of RA 6713.

P oceeding to the merits oft he petition, petitioners argue that they have a clear nd unmistakable right for the release and payment of their retirement benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof and wh~ch respondents unlawfully neglected to perform.

It is an extraordinary remedy issued only in cases of extreme necessity where the ordinary course of procedure is powerless to afford adequate and speedy relief to one who has a clear legal right to the perform nee of the act to be compelled.95 Moreover, its principal function is to com and and to expedite, not to inquire and to adjudicate96 U1 der our Rules, the remedy of mandamus is governed by Rule 65, Section of the Rules of Court, viz.: Section 3.

B cause of its nature as an extraordinary remedy, mandamus will lie only if t e following requisites are present: first, the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the act demanded, or those rights which are founded in law, are specific certain, clear, established, complete, undisputed or unquestioned, and are ithout any semblance or color of doubt;97 second, it must be the duty of the d fendant to perform the act, because it is mandated by law; third, the defenda t unlawfully neglects the performance of the duty enjoined by law; fourth, t e act to be performed is ministerial, not discretionary; and, fifth there is no ap eal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course f law.98 C se law provides that a purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer r tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obed ence to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. 99 t connotes an act in which nothing is left to the discretion of the person xecuting it. It is a simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitte or proved to exist and imposed by law.100 If the law imposes a duty upon a ublic officer and gives them the right to decide how or when the duty shall be erformed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministe al only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of offic· al discretion or judgment.101 This notwithstanding, case law settles that ma damus is available to compel action, when refused, on matters involvin discretion, but not to direct the exercise ofj udgment or discretion one way or the other.102 Relevan facts and circumstances governing petition rs ' claim A plying the foregoing concepts and considering the extraordinary nature f the remedy of mandamus, it is pertinent first to highlight several undispu ed facts that are crucial to the resolution of petitioners' claim: (i) the GCG approved the SRA's RATPLAN; 97 Naza~ o v. City ofD umaguete, 601 Phil. 768,800 (2009) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, En Banc). 98 Provin e of Maguindanao de/ Norte v. Bureau of Local Government Finance, G.R. No. 265373, Nove ber 13, 2023 [Per J.

See tzlso Hipos v. Hon. Bay, 600 Phil. 720, 737 (2009) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, Third Divisi ]; Decisio 22 G.R. No. 254757 (ii) the GCG required the SRA to (a) adopt and offer the r tirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the i plementation of the reorganization strengthening, and (b) implement t e new structure and staffing \"within two (2) months after receipt of [ he GCG's approval of the RATPLAN]\"; (iii) petitioners have been retired/separated from their e ployment with the SRA on August 1, 2016 upon availing of the early r tirement incentive program that it (the SRA) offered pursuant to its TPLAN; (iv) petitioners were qualified and complied with the r quirements for availing of the ERIP and had no participation in the i plementation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the ERIP other than a plying for the latter; and (v) petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies to s cure the release of their retirement benefits, all of which proved futile. T ese crucial facts must never be lost in the Court's consideration of petition rs' plea as the sole issue in the Court's resolution of the Petition is whethe petitioners are entitled to the issuance of mandamus to command and expedit the release of their retirement benefits. F r these reasons and by the very nature of the remedy of mandamus, the pro riety of the actions taken in the implementation of the RATPLAN and the ERI will not be the subject of the Court's present disquisition. Verily, any pe ceived error that may have been committed or omitted in the implem ntation of the ERIP should be addressed by the relevant authorities in the roper forum. Regardless, the same has and should not bear any relevan e to petitioners' present plea before the Court for the release of their long ov rdue retirement benefits which the interest of justice and fair play compel the Court to finally and fully resolve. The gra t ofE RIP benefits to petitioners 10154 ensures the \"timely and expeditious release of the retirement pay ... and other benefits of retiring government employees.\" Having spent the bes years of their lives serving the government, these government employ es are assured by the State that they will not be made to wait to receive the benefits due to them under the law. Accordingly, RA 10154 mandat s that \"high priority shall be given to the payment and/or settlement of the ... retirement benefits of retiring government employees.\"103 The '° 3 See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. I. 23 G.R. No. 254757 govern ent employees covered by RA 10154 includes those serving in all branch s of the government, including GOCCs such as the SRA.104 nder Section 2 of the same law, the head of the government agency conce ed is mandated to ensure the release of the retirement pay and other benefit of a retiring government employee within a period of 30 days from the dat of the actual retirement of said employee. The immediate release of the reti ment pay is, however, subject to the condition that \"all requirements are sub itted to the concerned government agency within at least 90 days prior to he effective date of retirement.\" The unjustified failure and/or refusal to rele se the retirement benefits due to a retiring government employee within hese periods shall result in administrative liability, unless the non release of the retirement benefits is due to ''force majeure and other ble causes.\"105 ese prov1s1ons are reiterated in Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013, as amended by Resolution No. 1302242, dated October 1, 2013, hich the CSC issued to implement the provisions of RA 10154, pursuan to Section 6 thereof. In addition, the CSC Resolutions implementing RA 10 54 (IRR), details the responsibilities of the employer-agency, the retiring employees, and the DBM, with respect to the pro~essing of the retirem nt pay of the retiring employee, including the relevant periods governi g the same, as well as the requirements for availing thereof, viz.:106 RULE IV R SPONSIBILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER-AGENCY AND RETIRING EMPLOYEES Section 8. Responsibilities of Employer-Agency. The government a ency where the employee will retire shall: a. Send the retiring employee a letter not later than one (1) year prior to the effectivity of his/her retirement, informing him/her to submit his/her expression of intent to retire as provided under Section 9 hereof, and notifying him/her to submit the necessary requirements at least one hundred (100) days prior to the effectivity date of his/her retirement. Moreover, the employer-agency shall compute the retiree's total number of accumulated years of government service. Should the same be less than fifteen (15) years at the retiree's expected date of retirement, the retiree shall be informed that he/she may request directly before the CSC for the extension of his/her service. For this purpose, the extension of service shall in no case 104 See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. 4. ios See Re ublic Act No. 10154, Sec. 5. 106 See Re olution No. 1300237, Sec. 8 to Sec. IO. Decision 24 G.R. No. 254757 exceed one (1) year and shall be subject to existing civil service laws, rules, and regulations. b. Upon submission of an employee's written intent to retire, provide the retiring employee with the retirement application form, with the accompanying checklist of all the requirements for retirement purposes; c. Upon submission of the requirements, the date of such submission shall be stamp marked on the corresponding item in the retirement application form in clear bold marked, countersigned by the proper receiving and validating employee; d. Process the application for retirement, compute the appropriate retirement benefits, and verify the authenticity, accuracy, and consistency of the data contained in the documents submitted; e. Not later than ninety (90) days prior to the actual date of retirement, endorse to GSIS, [DBM] and other concerned agencies the request of the retiring employee together with the complete set of documentary requirements; f. Submit, as part of its budget proposal to the DBM, a list of its officials and employees who shall compulsorily retire in the next succeeding fiscal year for the latter's incorporation in the Pension and Gratuity Fund; h. Upon receipt of the required funds form the DBM, record and release such funds to the retiring employee within the period prescribed under Section 5. Section 9. Responsibilities of Retiring Employee. The retiring e ployee shall: a. Submit a written expression of intent to retire indicating the desired date of retirement and the retirement package he/she intends to avail at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to his/her actual retirement date; and b. Submit the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the employer-agency not later than one hundred (100) days prior to the actual/intended date of retirement. RULEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE [DBM] Section I 0. Responsibilities of the [DBM]. For terminal leave b nefits and retirement gratuity under . . . Republic Act No. 1616, as a ended, and other relevant laws, the DBM shall perform the following: c. Within one (I) day from receipt of documents, ascertain whether all documents in the prescribed standard list have been Decision 25 G.R. No. 254757 submitted, and if incomplete, immediately call the attention of the employer-agency; d. Within ten ( I 0) days from submission of all documentary requirements, verify the computation, ascertain whether the grant and amount of retirement benefits are in accordance with law, and release the required funds to the employer-agency; Provided, that an additional ten (10) days shall be required if initial findings indicate that a more comprehensive legal due diligence is needed. (Emphasis supplied) S gnificantly, under these provisions, the sole responsibility of the retiring ovemment employee with respect to the release of their retirement benefits is to submit, within the prescribed periods, their written expression of inten to retire and the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the e ployer-agency. Upon their performance thereof, the retiring ent employees have nothing more to do than wait for their retirement thereafter the release of their retirement benefits which should not be 30 days from the actual date of their retirement. Meanwhile, the responsibility for processing and ensuring the timely release f the retirement benefits is primarily lodged with the employer agency d the DBM who, by their nature, holds the relevant power and authorit over the necessary documents and funds for the payment thereof. that the necessary documents and prerequisite steps have been complie with, the tasks to be performed by them, within specified timelines or perio s, in processing the retirement application and retirement benefits are mandat ry leaving no room for discretion. For this reason, the administrative sanctio for the unjustified non-payment of the retirement benefits is imposed only on the officials and/or employees of these agencies who holds the respons • ility of ensuring the timely release of the same. I this case, it is well to recall that in 2015, the SRA formulated the RAT PL to strengthen its organizational structure and capacity to enable it to fulfil the objectives of RA 10659. On April 12, 2016, the GCG approved the S 's RATPLAN under MO No. 2016-05. In the implementation of the RATPL N, the GCG set as conditions, that: (i) the SRA shall \"adopt and offer th retirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the imp mentation oft he organizational strengthening using the incentives provide under EO No. 203;\" and (ii) the new organizational structure and staffing hall be implemented within 2 months after receipt ofM O No. 2016- 05. The incentives referred to in MO No. 2016-05 are found in Section 7 of EO No. 03, series of 2016, viz.: SEC. 7. Early Retirement Incentive Plan (ERIP). - All Officers Employees covered by the CPCS who voluntarily elect to be retired or Decisio 26 G.R. No. 254757 •a y be separated from the service, as part of the performance by GCG of i mandate under Section 5(a) of R.A. No. I 0149 to rationalize, reorganize, erge, or restructure a GOCC, shall be granted the following early r tirement incentive in addition to retirement or separation benefits under e isting laws: Government Service Rates , First 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 20 years and 1 day to 30 years I .25 x BMP x No. of years 30 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years *Basic Monthly Pay (BMP) P rsuant to the foregoing conditions fixed by MO No. 2016-05, the SRA is ued Memorandum IAD-2016-May-003 informing all its employees of the proval of its RA TPLAN and further inviting those who wanted to avail o the ERIP. The SRA likewise set August 1, 2016 as the effective date of sepa ation from the service of those who availed of the ERIP, which include petitioners, to coincide with the two-month period set for the implem ntation of the SRA's new organization structure and staffing, followi g the condition set in MO No. 2016-05. espite their separation from the service on August 1, 2016, however, petition[rs' retirement benefits were not released due to the absence of the require guidelines for the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2016, as require under Section 3 thereof. In the interim, EO No. 36. series of 2017 was iss ed suspending the implementation ofEO No. 203, series of 2016, and concom tantly the issuance of the required guidelines, further delaying the release f petitioners' retirement benefits. T be sure, the Court recognizes that the early retirement package offered o petitioners used the incentives provided under EO No. 203, series of 201 , pursuant to MO No. 2016-05, and for this reason, gives the impress on that the retirement benefits due to petitioners were granted by EO No. 203 series of2016 which, having been suspended and thereafter repealed, have ah~ ady effectively forfeited petitioners' retirement benefits. T is impression aside, the Court is of the view that it was actually the RATPL N, which the GCG approved pursuant to the powers granted to it under S ction 5(a) of RA 10149-and not EO No. 203, series of2016-which formed he basis for the implementation of the early retirement package offered o petitioners. To emphasize, MO No. 2016-05, which approved the SRA's TPLAN, required the adoption and offering of retirement and separati n package for the affected personnel in recognition of the reality that the rear anization of the SRA would necessarily entail declaring certain position as redundant and concomitantly, the voluntary/involuntary separati n/retirement of certain employees from the service. Thus, to the Court's ind, the reference to EO No. 203, series of 2016 with respect to the Decision 27 G.R. No. 254757 retirem nt package to be offered to the affected SRA employees was made pursu t to State policy of standardizing the compensation of government official and employees, including those in the GOCCs. In other words, EO No. 20 , series of 2016 was referenced to serve merely as basis for the determi ation and computation of the amount of the retirement benefits due to eac retiring employee of the SRA. Accordingly, petitioners having comp Ii d with the requirements of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the r tirement and separation package offered in the implementation of the RA TP N, they have become entitled by law and equity to the corresponding retirem nt benefits. this regard, it should be borne in mind that the authority to determine a GOCC should be reorganized and-upon \"its determination that it best interest of the State that a GOCC should be reorganized\"-to the corresponding reorganization plan and early retirement incentive progr is lodged with the GCG pursuant to Section S(a) of RA 10149. Having pproved the SRA's RATPLAN, the same signified as an imprimatur by the tate, through the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid a lawful. Consequently, the absence of the implementing guidelines of EO o. 203, series of 2016, as well as the subsequent suspension thereof by EO o. 36, series of 2017, are not sufficient bases to deny petitioners their retirem nt benefits. tably, on October 11, 2021, EO No. 150, series of 2021 was issued approvi g and providing for the new CPCS and Index of Occupational Service, Position Titles, and Job Grades for GOCCs (IOS-G) Framework, thereby epealing EO No. 203, series of 2016. Subsequently, on January 12, 2022, t e GCG issued Guidelines No. 2021-001 to implement EO No. 150, series o 2021. Relevantly, Section 13 of EO No. 150, series of 2021, like Section 7 of EO No. 203, series of 2021, similarly authorizes the GCG, pursuan to Section 5(a) of RA 10149, \"to grant an [ERIP] to officers and employ es who voluntarily elect to be retired\" in accordance with the rates provide under Section 12, viz.: Government Service Rates irst 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 0 years and 1 day to 30 years 1.25 x BMP x No. of years 0 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years * asic Monthly Pay (BMP) oreover, the rates provided under Section 12 of EO No. 150, series of 2021 ar largely similar to those provided under Section 7 of EO No. 203, series o 2016. What evidently differs is the basic monthly pay from which shall be omputed the total amount of the retirement benefits which a retiring employ e shall receive. 28 G.R. No. 254757 his notwithstanding, and while there appears to be no explicit statem nt under EO No. 150, series of 2021 providing for its retroactive applica ion, the Court finds no justifiable and equitable reason not to consider the iss ance of EO No. 150, series of 2021 and its implementing guidelines as the emoval or cessation of the \"insuperable cause\" that prevented the release fpetitioners' retirement benefits to which they had long been entitled pursu t to the implementation of the RATPLAN. To rule otherwise would only le ve petitioners' claim indefinitely unresolved. Verily, the dictates of justice d equity call for an equitable resolution to petitioners' situation who has so ar not found relief in the various measures taken by them. quity, as the complement of legal jurisdiction, seeks to reach and do comp le e justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their rules and wa t of power to adapt their judgments to the special circumstances of cases, e incompetent to do so. \"Equity regards the spirit and not the letter, the inte t and not the form, the substance rather than the circumstance, as it is various y expressed by different courts.\"107 In the exercise of its equity jurisdic ion, the Court may adjust the rights of parties in accordance with the circum tances obtaining at the time of rendition of judgment, when these are signific ntly different from those existing at the time of generation of those rights.1 8 ccordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the Court, in the exercis of its equity jurisdiction, rules that petitioners are entitled to the payme of their retirement benefits which respondents the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM must determine, process, and facilitate with due dispatch. It must b emphasized herein that the Court, in making this declaration, is not directin the exercise of respondents' discretion one way or the other. Rather, the Cou is directing respondents to perform their respective mandated duties under 10154 and other relevant laws and rules. Evidently, matters relating to the s urce of the budget for the payment of petitioners' retirement benefits, the co utation thereof, the procedure for the release of the same, and other relevan details is subject to the respondents' discretion in the exercise of their respecti e powers and mandates. summary, the GCG's approval of the SRA's RATPLAN, in the of its discretion under RA 10149, signified as an imprimatur by the State, t ough the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid and law I. The early retirement package offered to petitioners and which they availed of was adopted pursuant to this approved RATPLAN. Upon their separati n from the service on August 1, 2016 and having complied with the require ents of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the retirement and sep ration package offered in the implementation of the RATPLAN, '° 1 Hacie da Luisita, Incorporated v.

Morea er, under RA 10154, the responsibility for processing, within specified periods or timelines and prerequisite steps, and ensuring the timely release of the peti ioners' retirement benefits are primarily lodged with the SRA and the DBM. Final final word. The Court's present disposition must be considered in the light of he surrounding circumstances of this case that has left petitioners with neither heir employment with the SRA nor the retirement benefits to which they ar entitled. As it is, petitioners' separation from the service is a fait accom i that can no longer be rectified by a misdirected emphasis and an obstina e insistence on the invalidity of the actions taken in the implem ntation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the corresponding early retirem nt package. Regardless of the various reasons that prevented the timely ffl ease of the retirement benefits, it is undisputed that petitioners have served t e government and have subsequently voluntarily retired therefrom to pave t e way for the SRA's reorganization. Clearly, no reasonable and justifia le objection can be made to further deny petitioners their retirement benefits which they are clearly entitled under the law.

Since the RATPLAN was formulated pursuant to EO No. 203, series o 2016 and RA 10149, and petitioners' separation/retirement from the SRA w s made pursuant thereto, their separation from the service cannot be conside ed illegal under the Constitution.

No comment was filed by or o behalf of the SRA. n October 11, 2021, petitioners filed a Manifestation47 informing the Court t at on October 1, 2021, EO No. 150, series of 2021 was issued approvi g the CPCS and Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles, and Job gr es for GOCCs (IOS-G) Framework and asserting that with the issuanc, thereof, \"there is no longer any impediment in the implementation of [their] RIP.\" Thus, they pray that the same be given by the Court judicial notice fi r the expeditious resolution of the petition.

The Case Before the Court titioners argue that they have a clear and unmistakable right for the release nd payment of their ERIP benefits and there is no other plain, speedy, and ade uate remedy in the ordinary course oflaw. Petitioners assert that with the pa ial implementation of the SRA's RATPLAN resulting in their separati n from the service affective August 1, 2016, they acquired a clear and u istakable right to the ERIP benefits which was offered and which they availed fpursuant to the approved RATPLAN.54 ongruently, petitioners claim that respondents unlawfully neglected the perfi rmance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. In this respect, petitioners point out that under Section 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 10154, the retirem nt benefits of retiring government employees shall be released to them w thin thirty days from their actual retirement date. While the running of the 0-day period can be tolled, the same can be justified only upon occurre ce off orce majeure or other insuperable circumstances.55 their case, petitioners claim that after receiving the funds intended ayment of their ERIP benefits from the DBM, the SRA has no other option ut to comply with its ministerial duty to release and pay the same pursuan to the IRR of RA 10154. As for the GCG, petitioners contend that the latt has no authority to advice the SRA to withhold the payment of the ERIP b nefits, notwithstanding the issuance of EO No. 36, series of 2017, because of the mandatory nature of the early release of the retirement benefits under 10154, and because EO No. 36, series of 2017, being prospective, covers nly government employees starting 2017 onwards. 56 F nally, petitioners underscore that despite their separation from the n August 1, 2016 and their numerous efforts to follow-up on the and release of the ERIP benefits, including the finality of the CSC directing the SRA to release the same, as well as their letters and appeal t the GCG and the OP which to date remain unanswered, they have yet to r ceive their ERIP benefits. Thus, they argue that they are left with no 54 Id. at 9-32. 55 Id. at 3 -35. 56 Id. Decision 11 G.R. No. 254757 recours but to file the present petition for mandamus before the Court to: (i) declare he ERIP to be valid and enforceable; (ii) declare GCG MC No. 2017- 03, whi h suspended their ERIP, as contrary to law; and (iii) \"command all respond nts to immediately pay and release their ERIP benefits with acceler ed dispatch. \"57 I their Comment,58 respondents GCG and DBM, through the OSG, primarilr argued that the Petition still suffers from fatal defects, despite the opportu ity given to petitioners to correct the same, and the filing thereof directly before the Court, violated the hierarchy of courts principle. Specifi lly, the OSG highlights the following defects in the petition: (a) the certific ion against forum shopping is not signed by all petitioners; (b) the Petition contains a false certification against forum shopping by stating that they ha e not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues a d that to the best of their knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending since as admitted, thirty-four of them filed before the Ombudsman a complai t involving the same issues; and (c) that the Petition does not specify the nam of all petitioners59 in the caption.60 Lastly, the OSG claims that the petition should have been filed before the Regional Trial Court-which has concurr nt jurisdiction over petitions for mandamus-and that the petition requires a determination of a question of fact, i.e., whether the requirements for the elease of their ERIP benefits have been complied with, which the Court c nnot resolve, it not being a trier of facts.61 n the merits, the OSG asserts that while petitioners are entitled to any benefits that may be due them under existing laws and rules, they nonetheless, failed t point out a clear legal right on their part to demand the release of their E P benefits and the corresponding ministerial duty on the part of the GCG a d the DBM to release the same that would justify the issuance of a writ of andamus. ·rstly, the OSG points out that petitioners' ERIP benefits are based on the S 's RATPLAN which was formulated and approved pursuant to EO No. 203, series of 2016. EO No. 203, series of 2016, however, required, as a precon •t ion for the computation and release of the ERIP benefits, the issuanc by the GCG of the corresponding implementing guidelines-which require ent the SRA ignored by setting the effectivity date of petitioners' early re irement on August 1, 2016 despite the GCG's reminders.63 51 Id. at 5-40. 58 Id. at 02-116. 59 Id. at 92.

Decision 12 G.R. No. 254757 orse, the OSG argues that the SRA implemented the RA TPLAN prior to the BM' s resolution of the former' s request tbr the inclusion in its 2016 Corpor te Operating Budget (COB) the needed amount for the payment of the ERIP b nefits which, lamentably, the DBM was constrained to deny for the same re son that the needed implementing guidelines for EO No. 203, series of 201 had not yet been issued. 64 Compounding the situation was the issuanc of EO No. 36, series of 2017, and the corresponding implementing guideli es under MC No. 2017-03, which suspended the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2017, including the provision on the ERIP.65 Parenth tically, the OSG argues that the subsequent issuance of EO No. 150, series f 2021 does not affect petitioners' case since the same applies prospec ively.66 S condly, the OSG counters petitioners' reliance on RA 10154 by pointin out that the mandatory release of the retirement benefits within the 30-day eriod is subject to the proviso that all the \"requirements are submitted to the c ncerned government agency at least 90 days prior to the effective date of retire\\ ent.\" In petitioners' case, this condition has not been complied with since th SRA submitted its request for supplemental budget with the DBM only on June 22, 2016 or 45 days before the effective date of petitioners' retirem nt on August 1, 2016.67 ·nally, the OSG asserts that the GCG and the DBM's respective duties with r spect to the retirement benefits of retired/retiring government employ es are discretionary, not ministerial. It argues that nowhere in RA 10149 •s it provided that the GCG has a ministerial duty to release the retirem nt benefits to GOCCs. At most, it has the duty to implement the SRA's eorganization plan, which covers petitioners' ERIP benefits. This duty, h wever, is discretionary since EO No. 203, series of 2016 specifically gave th GCG the authority to decide the requirements for and the details of the exe ution of the ERIP. Moreover, RA 10149 qualified the GCG's duty to implem nt the reorganization of GOCCs by a· contrary directive of the Preside t. In petitioners' case, the implementation of the SRA's RA TPLAN, includi g the payment of the ERIP benefits, was qualified by the contrary directiv of the President under EO No. 36, series of 2017 suspending the implem ntation of EO No. 203, series of2016.68 nent the DBM, the OSG points out that under the GCG Memorandum 2012-0 , the DBM has the duty to evaluate the annual budgetary support to GOCCs and evaluate and approve the annual COB of GOCCs, while under Rule V, Section l0(e) of the CSC Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013 i plementing RA 10154, the DBM has the duty to verify the 64 Id. at 00-201. 65 Id. at 01-202. 66 Id. at 88. 61 Id. at 02-203. 68 Id. at 03-205. 13 G.R. No. 254757 comput tion and ascertainment of whether the grant and amount of retirement benefit are in accordance with the law, among others. 69 their Reply70 to the GCG and the DBM's Comment, petitioners primari y claim the failure to include in the petition's caption of the names of some etitioners was due to mere inadvertence and at any rate, these petition rs signed the verification and certification of non-forum shopping which rms part of the body of the Petition. In this regard, petitioners invoke relaxati n of the strict application of the rules in the interest of justice and in view o the special and compelling circumstances of this case involving retired civil servants who have long been deprived of their retirement benefit .71 dditionally, petitioners argue that they did not commit forum shoppi nor was the certification they signed was falsified since the parties and cau es of action in the case filed before the Ombudsman and the present petition are different. 72 They likewise claim that their case presents special and co pelling reasons that justify direct recourse before the Court. 73 I L stly, anent the merits, petitioners maintain that they have a clear and unmista able right for the release and payment of their ERIP benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof. 74 The Issue Before the Court T e issue before the Court is whether mandamus should be issued against espondents to compel the release of petitioners' retirement benefits The Court's Ruling T e Petition is partly meritorious.

T e principle or doctrine of hierarchy of courts recognizes the jurisdic •o n and the various levels of courts in the country as they are establis ed under the Constitution and by law, and their relationship with one another. 5 It guides litigants as to the proper venue of appeals and/or the approp ate forum for the issuance of extraordinary writs. 76 It recognizes, too, the prac ical need to restrain parties from directly resorting to the Court when relief m y be obtained before the lower courts in order to prevent \"'inordinate demand upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters ithin its exclusive jurisdiction,' as well as to prevent the congestion of the ourt's dockets,\"77 and prevent the inevitable and resultant delay, intende or otherwise, in the adjudication of cases which often have to be remand d or referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of procedu e, or as the court better equipped to resolve factual questions.78 U der the Constitution's structure, the Supreme Court is designated as the high st court with irreducible powers, 79 whose rulings serve as precedents that oth r courts must follow because they form part of the law of the land. All oth courts are established and given their defined jurisdictions by law. As a rul , the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts and generally rules only on questio s of law;80 in contrast with the Court of Appeals and other 1s Associ tion of Medical Clinics for Overseas Workers, Inc. v.

At the lowest evel of courts are the municipal and the regional trial courts which also ha dle questions of fact and law at the first instance according to the j urisdic ion granted to them by law. 81 P rsuant to the foregoing structure and by its very essence, the hierarc y principle commands that cases must first be brought before the lowest ourt with jurisdiction, and not before the higher courts. These cases may ult mately reach the Supreme Court through the medium of an appeal or certior ri.82 Considering that jurisdiction and the leveling of the courts are defined by law, the hierarchy should leave very little opening for flexibility ( and po ential legal questions), except for the fact that the law has conferred concurr ntjurisdictions for certain cases or remedies to courts at different and defined levels. Petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and ha eas corpus, fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the regional trial courts a d the higher courts, including the Supreme Court. 83 Thus, parties are, as a ru e, required to file these petitions before the lower-ranked court; otherwi e, the petition may be dismissed outright. 84 onetheless, there are recognized exceptions to the general rule. In these si uations, the Court allows direct filing of the cases before it based on its auth rity to relax the application of its own rules. 85 Among the recognized excepti ns developed by case law' include: (a ) genuine issues of constit ionality that must be addressdd at the most immediate time;86 (b) (e) All cases in which only an error or question of law is involved.

As the Court held: \"the presence of one or more of the so called ' pecial and important reasons' is not the decisive factor considered by the Co in deciding whether to permit the invocation, at the first instance, of its orig\" al jurisdiction over the issuance of extraordinary writs. Rather, it is the na re of the question raised by the parties in those 'exceptions' that enable us to allow the direct action before us.\"89 this case, while the issue raised is not purely legal, the Court, in its discreti n, will nonetheless allow petitioners direct recourse and resolve the Petition on its merits in the broader interest ofj ustice, as will be discussed. oreover, the Court is compelled to address the issue raised in view of the exig ncy of the situation wherein petitioners appear to have been left with no othe plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. N otabl , there is no dispute that petitioners retired/separated from the SRA on August , 2016 pursuant to the ERIP that it offered to facilitate its RAT PLAN which t e GCG approved. Despite their retirement/separation on August 1, 2016, p titioners have not received any retirement benefits from the SRA to date- hich fact likewise remains undisputed. From the time they retired from th SRA, petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies before the SRA, th GCG and even before the OP, among others, to secure the release of their retirement benefits-all of which proved futile.

No. 254757 sever~l of them have filed a complaint before the Ombudsman involving the same 1s ues. ule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, as further amended, states that \"the pl intiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other i itiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certific tion annexed thereto and simultaneous~y filed therewith: a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same is ues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his kno ledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status t ereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action r claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) alendar days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initi tory pleading has been filed.\" The failure of the plaintiff or principal party to comply therewith \"shall not be curable by mere amendment of the compla\"nt or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice.\" Thus, as a rule, all the plaintiff or principal parties to a cas must sign the certification of non-forum shopping, failing in which will wa ant the dismissal of the case. owever, in Altres v. Empleo,91 the Court held that the failure of the otherp itioners to sign the certification of non-forum shopping for justifiable reasons should not result in the outright dismissal of the case. Verily, the signing of the certification by more than a majority of the petitioners, as in this cas , \"already sufficiently assures the Court that the allegations in the pleadin are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of spec lation; that the pleading is filed in good faith; and that the signatories are unq estionably real parties-in-interest who undoubtedly have sufficient knowle ge and belief to swear to the truth of the allegations in the petition.\"92 To prov de guidance for the bench, the bar, and the public, the Court inAltres further summarized the guidelines found in case law respecting non compli ce with the requirements on, or submission of defective, verification and cert fication of non-forum shopping, viz.: For the guidance of the bench and bar, the Court restates in capsule the jurisprudential pronouncements already reflected above respecting n n-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of defective, v rification and certification against forum shopping: I) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the r uirement on or submission ofd efective verification, and non-compliance w th the requirement on or submission of defective certification against ~ m shopping. 91 594 P ·1. 246 (2008) [Per J. Carpio Morales, En Banc]. 92 Id. at 0. Decision 19 G.R. No. 254757 2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein d es not necessarily render the· pleading fatally defective. The court may o der its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending c cumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be d spensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby. 3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one o has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the c mplaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the p tition have been made in good faith or are true and correct. 4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance t erewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not c rable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the round of \"substantial com liance\" resence of \"s ecial circumstances or com ellin reasons.\" 5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by a the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not si n will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or • stifiable circumstances however as when all the laintiffs or titioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of a tion or defense the si nature of onl one of them in the certification a ainst forum sho in substantiall com lies with the Rule. 6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be e ecuted by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for re sonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must e ecute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to on his behalf. 93 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) re, petitioners undoubtedly share a common interest and invoke a comma cause of action, i.e., the release of their long-awaited ERIP benefits which t ey availed of pursuant to the SRA's RATPLAN which they have yet to recei e despite their separation from the service since 2016. Under these circums ances, petitioners' substantial compliance with the requirements of the rule and the presence of special and compelling reasons should not merit the out •g ht dismissal of their petition without defeating the administration of justice. F nally, the alleged false certification must be brushed aside for lack of merit. petitioners aptly argued, the parties and causes of action in the case filed be re the Ombudsman and the present Petition are different. Indeed, the complai t before the Ombudsman was filed against the administrator94 of the SRA an , while praying for the release of their ERIP benefits, essentially sought t hold the latter liable for non-compliance with the CSC's Decision and for iolation of RA 10154 and Section 5(a) of RA 6713. In contrast, the present etition filed against the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM ultimately 93 Id. at 2 1-262; citations omitted. 94 Specifi ally named as respondent was SRA Administrator Hermenigildo R. Serafica; rollo, p. 63. 20 G.R. No. 254757 Decisiol seeks t compel these government agencies to release their ERIP benefits which t ey purportedly have negligently failed to do so. 11 told, petitioners' substantial compliance and the surrounding circum tances of the case justify the relaxation of the procedural rules in the broader interest ofj ustice. II. P oceeding to the merits oft he petition, petitioners argue that they have a clear nd unmistakable right for the release and payment of their retirement benefits which existing laws and rules require the immediate payment thereof and wh~ch respondents unlawfully neglected to perform. The GCG and the DBM, n the other hand, assert that petitioners failed to point out a clear legal right o their part to demand the release of these benefits and the corresp nding ministerial duty on the part oft he GCG and the DBM to release the sam . nd concept ofm andamus andamus is a command issuing from a court of law of competent jurisdic •o n, in the name of the state or sovereign, directed to some in erior court, tribunal, or board, or to some corporation or person, equiring the performance of a particular duty therein specified, which duty res Its from the official station of the party to whom the writ is directed, or from peration of law. It is an extraordinary remedy issued only in cases of extreme necessity where the ordinary course of procedure is powerless to afford adequate and speedy relief to one who has a clear legal right to the perform nee of the act to be compelled.95 Moreover, its principal function is to com and and to expedite, not to inquire and to adjudicate96 U1 der our Rules, the remedy of mandamus is governed by Rule 65, Section of the Rules of Court, viz.: Section 3. Petition for mandamus. - When any tribunal, oration, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance o an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an o ce, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and e •o yment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no ot er plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the p son aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, al eging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered c mantling the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be 95 Specia People, Inc.

No. 254757 s ecified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights o the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by r on of the wrongful acts of the respondent. B cause of its nature as an extraordinary remedy, mandamus will lie only if t e following requisites are present: first, the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the act demanded, or those rights which are founded in law, are specific certain, clear, established, complete, undisputed or unquestioned, and are ithout any semblance or color of doubt;97 second, it must be the duty of the d fendant to perform the act, because it is mandated by law; third, the defenda t unlawfully neglects the performance of the duty enjoined by law; fourth, t e act to be performed is ministerial, not discretionary; and, fifth there is no ap eal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course f law.98 C se law provides that a purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer r tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obed ence to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. 99 t connotes an act in which nothing is left to the discretion of the person xecuting it. It is a simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitte or proved to exist and imposed by law.100 If the law imposes a duty upon a ublic officer and gives them the right to decide how or when the duty shall be erformed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministe al only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of offic· al discretion or judgment.101 This notwithstanding, case law settles that ma damus is available to compel action, when refused, on matters involvin discretion, but not to direct the exercise ofj udgment or discretion one way or the other.102 Relevan facts and circumstances governing petition rs ' claim A plying the foregoing concepts and considering the extraordinary nature f the remedy of mandamus, it is pertinent first to highlight several undispu ed facts that are crucial to the resolution of petitioners' claim: (i) the GCG approved the SRA's RATPLAN; 97 Naza~ o v. City ofD umaguete, 601 Phil. 768,800 (2009) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, En Banc). 98 Provin e of Maguindanao de/ Norte v. Bureau of Local Government Finance, G.R. No. 265373, Nove ber 13, 2023 [Per J.

No. 254757 (ii) the GCG required the SRA to (a) adopt and offer the r tirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the i plementation of the reorganization strengthening, and (b) implement t e new structure and staffing \"within two (2) months after receipt of [ he GCG's approval of the RATPLAN]\"; (iii) petitioners have been retired/separated from their e ployment with the SRA on August 1, 2016 upon availing of the early r tirement incentive program that it (the SRA) offered pursuant to its TPLAN; (iv) petitioners were qualified and complied with the r quirements for availing of the ERIP and had no participation in the i plementation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the ERIP other than a plying for the latter; and (v) petitioners have taken numerous steps and remedies to s cure the release of their retirement benefits, all of which proved futile. T ese crucial facts must never be lost in the Court's consideration of petition rs' plea as the sole issue in the Court's resolution of the Petition is whethe petitioners are entitled to the issuance of mandamus to command and expedit the release of their retirement benefits. F r these reasons and by the very nature of the remedy of mandamus, the pro riety of the actions taken in the implementation of the RATPLAN and the ERI will not be the subject of the Court's present disquisition. Verily, any pe ceived error that may have been committed or omitted in the implem ntation of the ERIP should be addressed by the relevant authorities in the roper forum. Regardless, the same has and should not bear any relevan e to petitioners' present plea before the Court for the release of their long ov rdue retirement benefits which the interest of justice and fair play compel the Court to finally and fully resolve. The gra t ofE RIP benefits to petitioners 10154 ensures the \"timely and expeditious release of the retirement pay ... and other benefits of retiring government employees.\" Having spent the bes years of their lives serving the government, these government employ es are assured by the State that they will not be made to wait to receive the benefits due to them under the law.

The immediate release of the reti ment pay is, however, subject to the condition that \"all requirements are sub itted to the concerned government agency within at least 90 days prior to he effective date of retirement.\" The unjustified failure and/or refusal to rele se the retirement benefits due to a retiring government employee within hese periods shall result in administrative liability, unless the non release of the retirement benefits is due to ''force majeure and other ble causes.\"105 ese prov1s1ons are reiterated in Resolution No. 1300237, dated January 30, 2013, as amended by Resolution No. 1302242, dated October 1, 2013, hich the CSC issued to implement the provisions of RA 10154, pursuan to Section 6 thereof.

RULEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE [DBM] Section I 0. Responsibilities of the [DBM]. For terminal leave b nefits and retirement gratuity under . . . Republic Act No. 1616, as a ended, and other relevant laws, the DBM shall perform the following: c. Within one (I) day from receipt of documents, ascertain whether all documents in the prescribed standard list have been Decision 25 G.R. No. 254757 submitted, and if incomplete, immediately call the attention of the employer-agency; d. Within ten ( I 0) days from submission of all documentary requirements, verify the computation, ascertain whether the grant and amount of retirement benefits are in accordance with law, and release the required funds to the employer-agency; Provided, that an additional ten (10) days shall be required if initial findings indicate that a more comprehensive legal due diligence is needed. (Emphasis supplied) S gnificantly, under these provisions, the sole responsibility of the retiring ovemment employee with respect to the release of their retirement benefits is to submit, within the prescribed periods, their written expression of inten to retire and the complete documentary requirements prescribed by the e ployer-agency. Upon their performance thereof, the retiring ent employees have nothing more to do than wait for their retirement thereafter the release of their retirement benefits which should not be 30 days from the actual date of their retirement. Meanwhile, the responsibility for processing and ensuring the timely release f the retirement benefits is primarily lodged with the employer agency d the DBM who, by their nature, holds the relevant power and authorit over the necessary documents and funds for the payment thereof. that the necessary documents and prerequisite steps have been complie with, the tasks to be performed by them, within specified timelines or perio s, in processing the retirement application and retirement benefits are mandat ry leaving no room for discretion. For this reason, the administrative sanctio for the unjustified non-payment of the retirement benefits is imposed only on the officials and/or employees of these agencies who holds the respons • ility of ensuring the timely release of the same. I this case, it is well to recall that in 2015, the SRA formulated the RAT PL to strengthen its organizational structure and capacity to enable it to fulfil the objectives of RA 10659. On April 12, 2016, the GCG approved the S 's RATPLAN under MO No. 2016-05. In the implementation of the RATPL N, the GCG set as conditions, that: (i) the SRA shall \"adopt and offer th retirement and separation package for the affected personnel in the imp mentation oft he organizational strengthening using the incentives provide under EO No. 203;\" and (ii) the new organizational structure and staffing hall be implemented within 2 months after receipt ofM O No. 2016- 05. The incentives referred to in MO No. 2016-05 are found in Section 7 of EO No. 03, series of 2016, viz.: SEC. 7. Early Retirement Incentive Plan (ERIP). - All Officers Employees covered by the CPCS who voluntarily elect to be retired or Decisio 26 G.R. No. 254757 •a y be separated from the service, as part of the performance by GCG of i mandate under Section 5(a) of R.A. No. I 0149 to rationalize, reorganize, erge, or restructure a GOCC, shall be granted the following early r tirement incentive in addition to retirement or separation benefits under e isting laws: Government Service Rates , First 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 20 years and 1 day to 30 years I .25 x BMP x No. of years 30 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years *Basic Monthly Pay (BMP) P rsuant to the foregoing conditions fixed by MO No. 2016-05, the SRA is ued Memorandum IAD-2016-May-003 informing all its employees of the proval of its RA TPLAN and further inviting those who wanted to avail o the ERIP. The SRA likewise set August 1, 2016 as the effective date of sepa ation from the service of those who availed of the ERIP, which include petitioners, to coincide with the two-month period set for the implem ntation of the SRA's new organization structure and staffing, followi g the condition set in MO No. 2016-05. espite their separation from the service on August 1, 2016, however, petition[rs' retirement benefits were not released due to the absence of the require guidelines for the implementation of EO No. 203, series of 2016, as require under Section 3 thereof. In the interim, EO No. 36. series of 2017 was iss ed suspending the implementation ofEO No. 203, series of 2016, and concom tantly the issuance of the required guidelines, further delaying the release f petitioners' retirement benefits. T be sure, the Court recognizes that the early retirement package offered o petitioners used the incentives provided under EO No. 203, series of 201 , pursuant to MO No. 2016-05, and for this reason, gives the impress on that the retirement benefits due to petitioners were granted by EO No. 203 series of2016 which, having been suspended and thereafter repealed, have ah~ ady effectively forfeited petitioners' retirement benefits. T is impression aside, the Court is of the view that it was actually the RATPL N, which the GCG approved pursuant to the powers granted to it under S ction 5(a) of RA 10149-and not EO No. 203, series of2016-which formed he basis for the implementation of the early retirement package offered o petitioners. To emphasize, MO No. 2016-05, which approved the SRA's TPLAN, required the adoption and offering of retirement and separati n package for the affected personnel in recognition of the reality that the rear anization of the SRA would necessarily entail declaring certain position as redundant and concomitantly, the voluntary/involuntary separati n/retirement of certain employees from the service. Thus, to the Court's ind, the reference to EO No. 203, series of 2016 with respect to the Decision 27 G.R. No. 254757 retirem nt package to be offered to the affected SRA employees was made pursu t to State policy of standardizing the compensation of government official and employees, including those in the GOCCs. In other words, EO No. 20 , series of 2016 was referenced to serve merely as basis for the determi ation and computation of the amount of the retirement benefits due to eac retiring employee of the SRA. Accordingly, petitioners having comp Ii d with the requirements of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the r tirement and separation package offered in the implementation of the RA TP N, they have become entitled by law and equity to the corresponding retirem nt benefits. this regard, it should be borne in mind that the authority to determine a GOCC should be reorganized and-upon \"its determination that it best interest of the State that a GOCC should be reorganized\"-to the corresponding reorganization plan and early retirement incentive progr is lodged with the GCG pursuant to Section S(a) of RA 10149. Having pproved the SRA's RATPLAN, the same signified as an imprimatur by the tate, through the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid a lawful. Consequently, the absence of the implementing guidelines of EO o. 203, series of 2016, as well as the subsequent suspension thereof by EO o. 36, series of 2017, are not sufficient bases to deny petitioners their retirem nt benefits. tably, on October 11, 2021, EO No. 150, series of 2021 was issued approvi g and providing for the new CPCS and Index of Occupational Service, Position Titles, and Job Grades for GOCCs (IOS-G) Framework, thereby epealing EO No. 203, series of 2016. Subsequently, on January 12, 2022, t e GCG issued Guidelines No. 2021-001 to implement EO No. 150, series o 2021. Relevantly, Section 13 of EO No. 150, series of 2021, like Section 7 of EO No. 203, series of 2021, similarly authorizes the GCG, pursuan to Section 5(a) of RA 10149, \"to grant an [ERIP] to officers and employ es who voluntarily elect to be retired\" in accordance with the rates provide under Section 12, viz.: Government Service Rates irst 20 years 1.00 x BMP* x No. of years 0 years and 1 day to 30 years 1.25 x BMP x No. of years 0 years and 1 day and above 1.50 x BMP x No. of years * asic Monthly Pay (BMP) oreover, the rates provided under Section 12 of EO No. 150, series of 2021 ar largely similar to those provided under Section 7 of EO No. 203, series o 2016. What evidently differs is the basic monthly pay from which shall be omputed the total amount of the retirement benefits which a retiring employ e shall receive. 28 G.R. No. 254757 his notwithstanding, and while there appears to be no explicit statem nt under EO No. 150, series of 2021 providing for its retroactive applica ion, the Court finds no justifiable and equitable reason not to consider the iss ance of EO No. 150, series of 2021 and its implementing guidelines as the emoval or cessation of the \"insuperable cause\" that prevented the release fpetitioners' retirement benefits to which they had long been entitled pursu t to the implementation of the RATPLAN. To rule otherwise would only le ve petitioners' claim indefinitely unresolved. Verily, the dictates of justice d equity call for an equitable resolution to petitioners' situation who has so ar not found relief in the various measures taken by them. quity, as the complement of legal jurisdiction, seeks to reach and do comp le e justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their rules and wa t of power to adapt their judgments to the special circumstances of cases, e incompetent to do so. \"Equity regards the spirit and not the letter, the inte t and not the form, the substance rather than the circumstance, as it is various y expressed by different courts.\"107 In the exercise of its equity jurisdic ion, the Court may adjust the rights of parties in accordance with the circum tances obtaining at the time of rendition of judgment, when these are signific ntly different from those existing at the time of generation of those rights.1 8 ccordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the Court, in the exercis of its equity jurisdiction, rules that petitioners are entitled to the payme of their retirement benefits which respondents the SRA, the GCG, and the DBM must determine, process, and facilitate with due dispatch. It must b emphasized herein that the Court, in making this declaration, is not directin the exercise of respondents' discretion one way or the other. Rather, the Cou is directing respondents to perform their respective mandated duties under 10154 and other relevant laws and rules. Evidently, matters relating to the s urce of the budget for the payment of petitioners' retirement benefits, the co utation thereof, the procedure for the release of the same, and other relevan details is subject to the respondents' discretion in the exercise of their respecti e powers and mandates. summary, the GCG's approval of the SRA's RATPLAN, in the of its discretion under RA 10149, signified as an imprimatur by the State, t ough the GCG, that the ERIP which petitioners availed of is valid and law I. The early retirement package offered to petitioners and which they availed of was adopted pursuant to this approved RATPLAN. Upon their separati n from the service on August 1, 2016 and having complied with the require ents of the laws and rules then existing for availing of the retirement and sep ration package offered in the implementation of the RATPLAN, '° 1 Hacie da Luisita, Incorporated v. Presidential Agrarian Reform Council, 676 Phil. 518,573 (2011) [Per J. Vel co, Jr., En Banc], citing LCK Industries, Inc. v. Planters Development Bank, 563 Phil. 957,974 (2007) [Per J. Chico-Nazario, Third Division]. 108 Agcao iv. Government Service Insurance System, 247-A Phil. 74 (1988)[Per J. Narvasa, First Division]. C l 1 \"° 29 G.R. No. 254757 petitio ers have become entitled by law and equity to the corresponding retirem nt benefits and to the timely release thereof pursuant to RA 10154. Morea er, under RA 10154, the responsibility for processing, within specified periods or timelines and prerequisite steps, and ensuring the timely release of the peti ioners' retirement benefits are primarily lodged with the SRA and the DBM. Final final word. The Court's present disposition must be considered in the light of he surrounding circumstances of this case that has left petitioners with neither heir employment with the SRA nor the retirement benefits to which they ar entitled. As it is, petitioners' separation from the service is a fait accom i that can no longer be rectified by a misdirected emphasis and an obstina e insistence on the invalidity of the actions taken in the implem ntation of the SRA's RATPLAN and the corresponding early retirem nt package. Regardless of the various reasons that prevented the timely ffl ease of the retirement benefits, it is undisputed that petitioners have served t e government and have subsequently voluntarily retired therefrom to pave t e way for the SRA's reorganization. Clearly, no reasonable and justifia le objection can be made to further deny petitioners their retirement benefits which they are clearly entitled under the law.
